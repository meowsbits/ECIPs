Most of this hashpower was rented or came from other chains, specifically Ethereum (ETH). A separate proof of work algorithm would encourage the development of a specialized Ethereum Classic mining community, and blunt the ability for attackers to purchase mercenary hash power on the open-market. \r\n\r\n* As a secondary benefit, deployed smart contracts and dapps running on chain are currently able to use `sha3()` in their code. This ECIP could open the possibility of smart contracts being able to evaluate chain state, and simplify second layer (L2) development. We recommend an op-cod / pre-compile be implemented in Solidity to facilitate this. \r\n\r\n* Ease of use in consumer processors. SHA3-256 is far more efficient per unit of hash than Ethash is. It requires very little memory and is a pre-compile on ARM standard processors, which is ubiquitous and easy to optimize for. \r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\n### Reason 1: Similarity to Bitcoin\r\nThe Bitcoin network currently uses the CPU-intensive SHA256 Algorithm to evaluate blocks. When Ethereum was deployed it used a different algorithm, Dagger-Hashimoto, which eventually became Ethash on 1.0 launch. Dagger-Hashimoto was explicitly designed to be memory-intensive with the goal of ASIC resistance [1]. It has been provably unsuccessful at this goal, with Ethash ASICs currently easily available on the market.\r\n\r\nSHA3-256 is the product of decades of research and the winner of a multi-year contest held by NIST that has rigorously verified its robustness and quality as a hashing algorithm. It is one of the only hashing algorithms besides SHA256 that is allowed for military and scientific-grade applications, and can provide sufficient hashing entropy for a proof of work system. This algorithm would position Ethereum Classic at an advantage in mission-critical blockchain applications that are required to use provably high-strength algorithms. [2]\r\n\r\nA CPU-intensive algorithm like SHA3 would allow both the uniqueness of a fresh PoW algorithm that has not had ASICs developed against it, while at the same time allowing for organic optimization of a dedicated and financially committed miner base, much the way Bitcoin did with its own SHA2 algorithm.\r\n\r\nIf Ethereum Classic is to succeed as a project, we need to take what we have learned from Bitcoin and move towards CPU-hard PoW algorithms.\r\n\r\n> At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. - Satoshi Nakamoto (2008-11-03) [3]\r\n\r\n*Note: Please consider this is from 2008, and the Bitcoin community at that time did not differentiate between node operators and miners. I interpret \"network nodes\" in this quote to refer to miners, and \"server farms of specialized hardware\" to refer to mining farms.*\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reason 2: Value to Smart Contract Developers\r\nIn Solidity, developers have access to the `sha3()` function, which allows a smart contract to efficiently calculate the hash of a given input. This has been used in a number of interesting projects launched on both Ethereum and Ethereum-Classic. Most Specifically a project called 0xBitcoin [4] - which the ERC-918 spec was based on.\r\n\r\n0xBitcoin is a security-audited [5] dapp that allows users to submit a proof of work hash directly to a smart contract running on the Ethereum blockchain. If the sent hash matches the given requirements, a token reward is trustlessly dispensed to the sender, along with the contract reevaluating difficulty parameters. This project has run successfully for over 10 months, and has minted over 3 million tokens [6].\r\n\r\nWith the direction that Ethereum Classic is taking: a focus on Layer-2 solutions and cross-chain compatibility; being able to evaluate proof of work on chain, will be tremendously valuable to developers of both smart-contracts and node software writers. This could greatly simplify interoperability. \r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nExample of a Smart contract hashing being able to trustlessly Keccak hash a hypothetical block header. Please Note that it is up to Solidity developers to update to the proper SHA3 in their code, or to develop a new op-code. \r\n![example](https://i.imgur.com/xh3WgCF.png)\r\n\r\nHere is an analysis of Monero's nonce-distribution for \"cryptonight\", an algorithm similar to Ethash, which also attempts to be \"ASIC-Resistant\" it is very clear in the picture that before the hashing algorithm is changed there is a clear nonce-pattern. This is indicative of a major failure in a hashing algorithm, and should illustrate the dangers of disregarding proper cryptographic security. Finding a hashing pattern would be far harder using a proven system like SHA3:\r\n\r\n![example](https://i.imgur.com/vVdmzm9.jpg)\r\n\r\nBased on analysis of the EVM architecture [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/223675625334898688/534597157693685760/eth.jpg) there are two main pieces that need to be changed:\r\n\r\n1. The Proof of work function needs to be replaced with SHA3-256\r\n1. The Function that checks the nonce-header  in the block needs to know to accept SHA3-256 hashes as valid for a block.\r\n\r\n![example](https://i.imgur.com/2hobqOL.png)\r\n\r\n```\r\n#### UNDER REVIEW AS OF NOW \r\n\r\nNote on `mixHash` + `nonceHeader` \r\n\r\nIn the current Ethash system, the mixHash is a 256-bit string constructed based on the state of the blockchain. This is concatenated with the nonceHeader, 64-bit, and the entirety (320-bits) of it is hashed to verify proof of work.\r\n\r\nFor this proposal we recommend miners being able to fill the `mixHash` field with whatever data they desire. This will allow for a total of 320-bits for miners to use for both submitting proof of work, but also to signal mining pools and voting on certain ECIP proposals.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nA testnet implementing this ECIP, is currently live, with more information available at [Astor.host](https://astor.host)\r\n\r\n* Fips 202 Standard for SHA3.
