Can we hold a CDC focused on addressing these consensus issues and try to resolve them prior to ECIP-1049's Oct 9th `Accepted` call? Hopefully this will prevent a chain split.\r\n\r\nIssue threads ref:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/342\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/13\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/8\r\ncdc ref:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/333\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/362\r\n\r\nLuke (xocel) from ETC Labs asked where to oppose the algo change in Discord after the CDC 13 call ended. It was noted that this 9/11 call was not about pro/opposing SHA3 but to decide between SHA3-256 or Keccak256 in the pro-SHA3 camp.\r\n\r\n[xx:04 AM] xocel: how do we express opposition to both keccak256 and sha3?\r\n[xx:05 AM] McDappas:\r\nhow do we express opposition to both keccak256 and sha3?\r\n@xocel  I think thats a different call\r\n[xx:05 AM] xocel: ok. cool.\r\n\r\nI think we all want to prevent chain splits, so this feels like an important step as there are only a few weeks left until ECIP-1049 moves to `Accepted` status on Oct-9. Lastly, I see an `Accepted` ECIP can still be moved to `Rejected` status. Can someone familiar with the process explain that in-depth should ECIP-1049 move forward and there is material contention?\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs#process-overview\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n  r0n1n\r\n\r\nHere are some noted vocal opposition from familar names that are more technical than myself (opposition was noted in github or on discord):\r\n- Dexaran @Dexaran https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/342#issuecomment-685208360\r\n- Belford @BelfordZ https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/13#issuecomment-551256069\r\n- Cody @realcodywburns (Discord discussions in `#general`)\r\n- Luke @iquidus  (Discord discussions in `#general`)",
