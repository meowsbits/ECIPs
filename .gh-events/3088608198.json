      "body": "Builds from #305 \r\n\r\nFixes all ECIP document validation issues and gets the CI suite to pass (and includes a new workflow `ECIP Validation` which validates ECIP document formats on `pull_request` and `push`). So we can depend on CI validation and deploy workflow as a requirement for merging PRs, for example.\r\n\r\nIncludes change sets:\r\n- fix(Gemfile.lock): bundle update and fix nokogiri security alert #302\r\n- fix(ecip1082): character that cannot start any token, line 5, col 9 #304\r\n- CI update for ECIP validation #305 \r\n\r\nFixes #292 \r\n\r\nAs you'll see in those individual PRs I've noted that this PR includes and then extends from them.\r\nIf anyone wants to reopen those more granular changes please just say so and we can do that. Fixing the ECIP documents for the validator to pass meant tweaking and fixing frontmatter fields and values, but otherwise no actual content was edited, and I tried to mess as little with the frontmatters as possible, eg.\r\n- https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/306/commits/dc20abfe315acd1c6213f686b643101824e821cf\r\n- https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/306/commits/431d7f8b6cfebb7fc1dba8c117e240db94368ac4\r\n- https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/306/commits/7a6a9a517fda9254422269fa957837aad62ac133\r\n\r\nThe new validator can be found here: https://github.com/meowsbits/ecip_validator and is published with rubygems here https://rubygems.org/gems/ecip_validator. As mentioned in #305, if there's interest in pushing forward a community-development version, I'd be happy to transfer it to github.com/ethereumclassic/."
