Identification of places where client optimization is essential to avoid DOS vectors and actually making those optimizations in Besu (disaster averted)\r\n\r\n2. Identification of ways in which the current gasprices are sub-optimal and could be tweaked to be better (EVM optimization - no disaster variant)\r\n\r\nAnd it would also be helpful to do the same systemic \"essential optimizations\" pass for Parity-Ethereum and Multi-Geth, and I would love that to happen, but the ETC Coop does not have spare money hanging around for that work."
