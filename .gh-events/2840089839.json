Given recent actions that Afri were not exactly following the \"protocol\" and were not exactly \"neutral\" in his position, I think it would be important to have some coordinator name list ready, in case we want to appoint a new one for all of our meetings.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to propose names or propose yourself. Current list:\r\n\r\n@YazzyYaz \r\n@phyro \r\n@TokenHash \r\n@developerkevin \r\n@mikeyb"
