      "body": "@BelfordZ @bobsummerwill are proposing to unify the license of ECIP repo under Apache v2. Since ECIPs are written by many people, we need permission from people who have contributed. If you've contributed code or documentation to ECIP **at any point**, we would like to get your permission. The recommended way to do this would be to leave a comment at this Github issue. It's also possible to grant the permission privately or anonymously. Please let us know if you have this need."
