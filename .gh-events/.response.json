This also applies to Ethereum Classic. In order for the development of the project to continue it is necessary to incentivize developers to take part in it. Having a professional development team also requires a permanent source of funding.\r\n\r\nWe have a [precedent of one of the main ETC development teams being shutdown due to lack of funding](https://ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-classic-etc-development-team-shuts-down-operations-due-to-funding/). ([announcement reference](https://twitter.com/etcdev/status/1069625401515872256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1069625401515872256&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cryptoglobe.com%2Flatest%2F2018%2F12%2Fleading-ethereum-classic-dev-team-quits-due-to-lack-of-funds%2F))\r\n\r\n[Ethereum Commonwealth](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth), the other ETC development team, adheres to the [policy of financial transparency](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/27). According to our public financial report, you can see that we did not receive any funding since July 2017 to the end of 2018.\r\n\r\nSummarizing the above, I can conclude that a permanent source of development funding is essential for further growth and maintenance of the project and ecosystem. This source of funding should be implemented at the protocol level.\r\n\r\nThe source of funding must ensure: \r\n- *financial transparency* - this is ensured by the ability to track transactions.\r\n- *constant cash flow* which must be used to incentivize contributors to develop Ethereum Classic core OR ecosystem.\r\n- *agnosticism* - third party contributors must have access to the source of funding even if they never contributed to ETC development before.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n#### General\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is based on [Callisto Network Treasury](https://whitepaper.io/document/345/callisto-network-whitepaper).\r\n\r\nCallisto Network Treasury advantages:\r\n\r\n1. Has a working implementation ([geth](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/go-callisto) / [parity](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/rust-callisto)) \r\n2. [Already tested](https://callisto.network/financial-report/) in real market environment.\r\n3. Simple and secure to implement/rollback.\r\n4. Compatible with ECIP-1017: ETC monetary policy.\r\n\r\n#### Technical\r\n\r\nThe proposed treasury system relies on two system addresses that receive funding at the protocol level. The protocol-level funding is a split of a base block reward. When a new block is mined, the reward is represented by three values: miner's block reward, `X` and `Y` where:\r\n\r\n- `X` goes to the first Treasury address.\r\n- `Y` goes to the second Treasury address.\r\n- `(base block reward - (X + Y))` goes to miner's address.\r\n\r\nThis is possible to implement the described scheme without changing the `base block reward`, thus keeping the original 5M20 Ethereum Classic monetary policy unaffected.\r\n\r\n"

With maximum gas usage it's reasonable to expect that sync times over the next few years will grow to the point where a normal users and even some businesses cannot fully validate the chain, leading to node centralization and the need for trusted intermediaries. \r\n\r\nWe have the benefit of hindsight and lower utilization but will face exactly the same problems if we do not take steps to address blockchain bloat.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nMiners can start reducing their gas limit to 1,000,000 by adding the below parameters to their clients. This change will happen over time with each block reducing by a maximum of 1/1024th of the gas of the previous block. More details on `gasLimitBoundDivisor` [are here](https://wiki.parity.io/Chain-specification).\r\n\r\n### Geth\r\n`--targetgaslimit 1000000`\r\n\r\n### Parity\r\n`--gas-floor-target 1000000 --gas-cap 0`\r\n\r\n### Mantis\r\n`TBD`\r\n\r\n### Code Changes\r\nA more robust method to decreasing gas target is to specify a default within each ETC client. Potential changes are detailed below:\r\n\r\n- Parity-Ethereum, Mantis, and Multi-Geth will require a small refactor such that the default is specified in a config file, rather than hard coded as is presently the case.\r\n- Geth-ETC, being a single-network client, can simply update the value [specified here](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/go-ethereum/blob/1a8b71b8f3e03775303182df7f446a93234ef89c/core/block_validator.go#L37)"

We know the precedents of large contract hacks, which led to the loss of large amounts of funds as well as undermining confidence in the industry as a whole. For example [TheDAO hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)), [Parity Multisig hack 1](https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/on-the-parity-wallet-multisig-hack-405a8c12e8f7), [Parity Multisig hack 2](https://medium.com/chain-cloud-company-blog/parity-multisig-hack-again-b46771eaa838), [ERC20 vulnerability led to the loss of millions of dollars](https://medium.com/@dexaran820/previously-described-at-erc20-critical-problems-medium-article-db616c84acc1).\r\n\r\nAs an information security engineer, I can say that formal verification, better coding standards, new programming languages, and other automated tools cannot significantly improve the fault-tolerance of smart contract systems.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the smart contracting industry still needs security improvements and decentralized, immutable, chain-agnostic environment which will ensure and preserve contract development/auditing history. I propose to establish a team of professional security auditors that will work to enhance the security of smart-contracts (for ETC or for the whole industry).\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n\r\n- ETC is definitely a proper immutable, decentralized, chain-agnostic environment which can serve the above goal.\r\n- ETC benefits from smart-contract security enhancement too, as ETC is a smart-contract development platform.\r\n- The total value of the entire cryptoindustry rises, which is also benefitial for ETC.\r\n- Unique use case for Ethereum CLassic blockchain, which can increase the network effect and boost the growth of the project and ecosystem.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nWe must not rely on blockchain technology to verify smart-contracts. We can only use it to provide a registry of audited contracts, publish and manage results of smart-contract audits.\r\n\r\n#### Security auditing team\r\n\r\n![alt text](https://github.com/Dexaran/Security-DAO-registry/blob/master/Audit_Reg_Flow.png)\r\n\r\nThe detailed description of Security Auditing organization can be found here: https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Auditing\r\n\r\nThere are two types of participants in the described organization: [managers](https://github.com/Dexaran/Security-DAO/blob/master/SecurityDAO.sol#L17) and [auditors](https://github.com/Dexaran/Security-DAO/blob/master/SecurityDAO.sol#L11-L18).\r\n\r\nThe main task of a manager is to control and verify the work of the auditors.\r\n\r\nThe main task of an auditor is to review a code of smart-contracts and submit [reports](https://github.com/Dexaran/Security-DAO/blob/master/SecurityDAO.sol#L29-L40). Auditors receive [karma](https://github.com/Dexaran/Security-DAO/blob/master/SecurityDAO.sol#L15) for reviewing contracts. They also receive [penalties](https://github.com/Dexaran/Security-DAO-registry/blob/master/SecurityDAO.sol#L17) for making mistakes. The statistic reflects each auditors results and determines their reward.\r\n\r\nThe audit process will be managed through github so that it will be transparently available for everyone. A smart-contract developer should open an [issue](https://github.com/Dexaran/Security-DAO/issues) to submit his smart-contract for auditors review. Then the manager will verify security audit request details and mark the issue as *approved*. The manager should not mark dummy requests, requests that aim to spam the security audit queue or any requests that does not met coding standard requirements. After that, **every** auditor can start reviewing the code. \r\n\r\nAn auditor with a willingness to participate in the code review of a certain contract must create a [private gist](https://gist.github.com/) and send gist URL to the corresponding issue manager by [email](https://github.com/Dexaran/Security-DAO/blob/master/SecurityDAO.sol#L14). E-mail address of each manager or auditor is transparently available at the smart-contract of this organization.\r\n\r\n#### Security Auditing organization governance.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the security auditing organization relies on [Treasury proposal](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/4) and rights delegation mechanism.\r\n\r\n1. Treasury voters owners establish the payment schedule for security auditing department, thus delegate the governance rights to the security auditing manager.\r\n\r\n2. Security auditing manager distributes the received payment between the auditing team members.\r\n\r\n3. If Treasury voters are not satisfied by the workflow of security department then they must fire the security auditing manager.\r\n\r\nIt is planned to automate the security auditing team workflow with a [SecurityDAO smart-contract](https://github.com/Dexaran/Security-DAO-registry) in 2019 however the contract is still in development. Security DAO smart-contract is not a critically important detail of this proposal.\r\n\r\n#### Outcome\r\n\r\nAs the result of the functioning system we receive a well-defined process of smart-contract security auditing. Each smart-contract is reviewed by at least 3 professional security auditors.\r\nSecurity audits are completely free-of-charge for smart-contract developers, thus every smart-contract developer is capable of ordering a security audit before deploying his/her smart-contract.\r\n\r\n- Security Auditing organization structure has a working implementation in Callisto Network.\r\n\r\n- [113 succesful security audits](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Auditing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) were performed during 2018.\r\n\r\n- According to Callisto Network statistics for 2018, this costs the ecosystem approx. $4000/month. I think that this is a reasonable price which should be paid to prevent such accidents as TheDAO hack and other hacks which caused much more losses.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements\r\n\r\nThis requires [Treasury Proposal](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/4) implementation.\r\n\r\n"

This also applies to Ethereum Classic. In order for the development of the project to continue it is necessary to incentivize developers to take part in it. Having a professional development team also requires a permanent source of funding.\r\n\r\nWe have a [precedent of one of the main ETC development teams being shutdown due to lack of funding](https://ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-classic-etc-development-team-shuts-down-operations-due-to-funding/). ([announcement reference](https://twitter.com/etcdev/status/1069625401515872256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1069625401515872256&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cryptoglobe.com%2Flatest%2F2018%2F12%2Fleading-ethereum-classic-dev-team-quits-due-to-lack-of-funds%2F))\r\n\r\n[Ethereum Commonwealth](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth), the other ETC development team, adheres to the [policy of financial transparency](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/27). According to our public financial report, you can see that we did not receive any funding since July 2017 to the end of 2018.\r\n\r\nSummarizing the above, I can conclude that a permanent source of development funding is essential for further growth and maintenance of the project and ecosystem. This source of funding should be implemented at the protocol level.\r\n\r\nThe source of funding must ensure: \r\n- *financial transparency* - this is ensured by the ability to track transactions.\r\n- *constant cash flow* which must be used to incentivize contributors to develop Ethereum Classic core OR ecosystem.\r\n- *agnosticism* - third party contributors must have access to the source of funding even if they never contributed to ETC development before.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n#### General\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is based on [Callisto Network Treasury](https://whitepaper.io/document/345/callisto-network-whitepaper).\r\n\r\nCallisto Network Treasury advantages:\r\n\r\n1. Has a working implementation ([geth](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/go-callisto) / [parity](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/rust-callisto)) \r\n2. [Already tested](https://callisto.network/financial-report/) in real market environment.\r\n3. Simple and secure to implement/rollback.\r\n4. Compatible with ECIP-1017: ETC monetary policy.\r\n\r\n#### Technical\r\n\r\nThe proposed treasury system relies on two system addresses that receive funding at the protocol level. The protocol-level funding is a split of a base block reward. When a new block is mined, the reward is represented by three values: miner's block reward, `X` and `Y` where:\r\n\r\n- `X` goes to the first Treasury address.\r\n- `Y` goes to the second Treasury address.\r\n- `(base block reward - (X + Y))` goes to miner's address.\r\n\r\nThis is possible to implement the described scheme without changing the `base block reward`, thus keeping the original 5M20 Ethereum Classic monetary policy unaffected.\r\n\r\n"
