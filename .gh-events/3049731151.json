      "body": "Issues with the _Aztlán_ protocol upgrades were identified and sufficiently patched with the _Phoenix_ protocol upgrades. However, the subsequent activation of these upgrades on the _Kotti_ and _Mordor_ testnets revealed inconsistencies between client implementations. This document proposes a patch for the aforementioned testnets.\r\n\r\n### Abstract\r\nThe [EIP-2200](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2200) defines structured definitions of net-gas metering for the `SSTORE` opcode. This EIP was activated in a bundle called [EIP-1679](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1679) \"Istanbul\" on the Ethereum Foundation network and [ECIP-1061](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1061) \"Aztlán\" on the Ethereum Classic network.\r\n\r\nNotably, the difference here is that _Istanbul_ contained [EIP-1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) which repriced various opcodes for trie-size dependent operations, whereas _Aztlán_ did not.\r\n\r\nBoth [EIP-1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) and [EIP-2200](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2200) propose the `SLOAD_GAS` to be increased from `200` to `800` but not all clients correctly implemented this change for both EIPs leaving networks configured with a pick-and-mix EIP configuration such as _Aztlán_ with an incompatible configuration as compared to clients who correctly implemented the specifications.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nThis specification seeks to validate the incomplete configuration in favor of retaining the _Kotti_ and _Mordor_ testnets in consensus. This ECIP shall not be considered on mainnet. It's sole purpose is to allow avoiding a rollback on the testnets and having a proper documentation on the cause for the gas mismatch and providing instructions for client developers how to circumvent this.\r\n\r\n### Discussions to:\r\n- https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/262",
