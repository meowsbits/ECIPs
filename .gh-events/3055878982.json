If it is a public simulation and test of ETC mainnet, it isn't a good one. So we can follow the logic of A: Testnets-as-service.\r\n\r\nMordor is a PoW network, so is is a pretty good simulator of ETC mainnet. We can follow the logic of B: Testnets-as-test, and not only resolve the issue of EIP2200 correction, but improve the network's simulation of mainnet activation for ECIP1061 and ECIP1078.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRendered: https://github.com/meowsbits/ECIPs/blob/feat/ecip1087/_specs/ecip-1087.md"
