    "body": ">The miners never send them to 0x0\r\n\r\nWouldn't the same argument apply for the case that the 20% is sent to the proto-treasury contract? We think this is just a matter of how you're viewing what's happening with the block reward, if you see the miners as selecting were the 20% of the emission would go to (as they do as well with the other 80% with the coinbase address) you remove that impossible event happening of sending the coins without owner.\r\n\r\n>Coins that are not on the chain and don't exist have exactly the same usage properties as the coins burned by the miners\r\n\r\nWe agree with this! And tbh we only see a (maybe minor?) difference between burning the 20% or never emitting them in the first place, in terms of users/miners effect we don't see anything that would change if you go one way or the other.\r\n\r\nThe only difference we see for now is that as the total number of coins emmitted will be different, which:\r\n- if the 20% are never emitted, the total supply will be closer to what it really is\r\n- but calculations (and so estimations) of total supply will be more difficult, which might affect this pending question _\"Obtaining the exact total supply from a smart contract is not easy, and we'll probably need to make some estimations, like taking the average of a lower and upper bound.\"_",
