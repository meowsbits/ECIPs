    "body": "> Exactly. Both 1099 and 1100 are temporary solutions. EtcHash will be replaced by Keccak once this is ready. This buys us time to properly implement 1049.\r\n\r\nThis is good news from my standpoint. I had the impression there was a pushback against Keccak256.\r\n\r\n> I would say 12 months would be a safe timeline, 9 months is the absolute minimum.\r\n\r\nBased on your description above, 9-12 months makes sense. I agree with that.\r\n\r\n> Keccak does not requires us to wait 9 months, it requires us to work hard 9 months.\r\n\r\nYes. I used the term \"wait\" but I understand it involves real work from the part of devs participating in the change. For non-devs it's just \"wait\" that's why I used that term.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nSo, in terms of MESS and 1099 as hot fixes to eventually migrate to 1049 I have that clear now. \r\n\r\nAs to MESS, I don't think it is a good idea to have it as an option for some or other exchanges and miners to decide independently  whether to follow one chain or the other, that may lead to splits no? In any case I would do a hard fork with MESS and Epoch Duration in one hard fork, and in parallel work on Keccak256 for 12 months. (again if MESS solves reorgs, I don't know why go through the work of doing Epoch Duration)\r\n\r\nAs to the Treasury, that leaves that issue as a divisive item. From my standpoint, The MESS -> Epoch Duration -> Keccak256 track is acceptable. ",
