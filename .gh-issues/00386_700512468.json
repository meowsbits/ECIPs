    "body": "> @q9f so what you are describing is also a sort of programme:\r\n> \r\n>     1. Now: implement ECIP-1099 + MESS\r\n>     2. In nine months: implement ECIP-1049 + delete ETCash (1099) and delete MESS\r\n\r\nExactly. Both 1099 and 1100 are temporary solutions. EtcHash will be replaced by Keccak once this is ready. This buys us time to properly implement 1049.\r\n\r\n> I see the \"training wheels\" purpose as current hash power is so low that it doesn't make ETC stable anyway. But,\r\n> \r\n>     * why is ECIP-1099 ready to go and ECIP-1049 not? Isn't 1099 equally untested and immature?\r\n>     * how can it be guaranteed that MESS is deleted? isn't it better to implement it with a termination date?\r\n\r\nBecause 1099 is literally just adding some lines to Ethash. It's a hotfix. It's neither elegant nor beautiful. But given that it is easy to implement and quick to activate, it buys us a lot of needed time to go through an involved change such as Keccak.\r\n\r\nMESS is not a consensus feature. You can just turn it on and off as you like. For core-geth, it's something like `--ecbp1100 999999999` to disable it anytime. It does not even require developer intervention. On the other hand, if you want to help exchanges to protect their funds in times like that, they could coordinate and override it already by activating it on mainnet, e.g. `geth --classic --ecbp1100 11380000`.\r\n\r\n> In any case, to implement MESS and 1099 now to wait for Keccak256 in 9 months, it's better to just implement MESS (with an expiration date) and wait for Keccak256 directly.\r\n\r\nThis is a massive misconception. _Developers don't wait._ They are working hard day in, day out, to progress Classic and to prevent further attacks. Solutions such as MESS and Epoch Duration are quick hotfixes that can be rolled out in just a couple of weeks, I can't stress this enough: Keccak does not requires us to _wait_ 9 months, it requires us to **work hard 9 months**. \r\n\r\nAnd 9 months is a overly optimistic timeline for such an involved change. We basically have to pull out the existing consensus engine and plug in a completely new engine _in-flight_, on a running system! No client, neither Geth, nor Besu, nor OpenEthereum are prepared for such a change. There needs to be massive architectural work.\r\n\r\nI would say 12 months would be a safe timeline, 9 months is the absolute minimum.",
