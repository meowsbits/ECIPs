    "body": "Maybe slightly off topic but has anyone explored weakening the subjectivity by weighing down blocks that have been checkpointed on other PoW chains like Bitcoin? \r\n\r\nThis would further weaken the weak subjective preference as preferring the heaviest ETC chain that was checkpointed on the heaviest Bitcoin chain first, leveraging Bitcoin objectivity . We could still have a MESS like weak subjective rule for blocks that haven't been checkpointed, but we would set up the weakest subjectivity rule to be weaker. \r\n\r\nI've seen a discussion about this being considered with A BFT scheme of trusted signers. I was thinking more along the lines of the the protocol providing a small accumulating bounty that could be withdrawn by a miner that can prove their checkpointing transaction received N confirmations (e.g 6 on Bitcoin). A back of the envelope calculation is that it would only take about 1-2% of the current ETC block rewards to provide sufficient incentive to have least one ETC checkpoint in every Bitcoin block, though that might be overkill.",
