    "body": "Adding my opinions:\r\nTL;DR: I'm supportive of a treasury system for development.\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I believe Charles' 1 week timeframe was related to garnering community support for an embedded treasury system. The other topics appear to be his ideas related to solving the current state of the network. It appeared that his primary concern was that there would be funding for his developers if he committed resources to the ETC network. Again, correct me if I'm wrong please.\r\n\r\nTreasury System:\r\nI am a fan of a treasury system to support decentralized development on ETC. Having a treasury has the potential to attract dev talent that we don't even know about. We will likely see many more ECIPs with innovative tech for this specific application of blockchain; be it L1 or L2 proposals. I personally see a lot more pros than cons.\r\n\r\nI am a fan of a funding system that's sole purpose is to advance the network itself. The Developers funding pool would be replenished by their ability to produce products that fill blocks (increased user usage). This appreciates the value prop of the network and aligns Developers and Miners incentives.\r\n\r\nA L1 example, there is a community desire for Account Versioning and no present development talent to champion this idea. A treasury would incentivize developers to meet the unanswered needs of the non-developer community. Currently, the active development teams have no signaled intent to work on this highly requested feature that will add backwards compatibility to the network.\r\n\r\nI agree with @Dexaran that L2 Smart Contracts can fund a majority of these funding mechs. But since ETC is still at that L1 focus, I'm not opposed to a baseline L1 portion of the inflation going to the developer. This will ensure that if blocks are being mined, development will be funded in a way that is solely reliant on the network (until the emission is 0); a big move away from third-party dependency (ETC Coop & ETC Labs models of funding development) which I view as a step in the right direction for decentralization of powers and segregation of duties in the ecosystem. Current material development funding comes from James Wo and Barry Silbert's private businesses. Let's add \"the public ETC Network\" to that list with a built in treasury system and remove third-party dependency for ETC development.\r\n\r\nA L2 example, there is an entire DeFi ecosystem that can be ported over to ETC with a dev funding mech built into its foundation. Currently ETH DeFi teams are extorting the third-party ETC money to \"Add ETC Support\". Heresay: I believe Uniswap wanted something like a million dollars to add ETC, this is not a feasibly approach. Also it is not logical to pay extortion fees when this network can fund this development and link into existing networks due to the permissionless nature of blockchains.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnknowns that I can not commit support for due to lack of knowledge and understanding at this moment:\r\n- I do not know the mechanics of the governance system Charles discussed \"Voltaire\".\r\n- I am hesitant to introduce a hybrid PoW/PoS model because I don't understand how this works yet. Also I am reluctant to any PoS due to so many poor implementations of it.",
