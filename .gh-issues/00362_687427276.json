    "body": "Hi, I would like to stick with original plan of a meeting on Sept 11 2020 @ 4 PM UTC. I have invited a number of guests for that time to attend the call, and computed a block activation strategy for this time. This fellow gitr0n1n has said in numerous places that he disagrees with this proposal, and has been harassing everyone associated with the proposal. This is another one of his ploys. Also he did not show up to the previous meeting, he can take a 90 minutes to show up to this one. \r\n\r\nSecond of all, I respect GitR0n1n's approach and will happily talk to him directly during the call and address his concerns. However this 9/11 excuse does not justify moving the meeting. I am an american and New Yorker who knows people directly affected, and Friday is a normal working day. So I say we continue.   ",
