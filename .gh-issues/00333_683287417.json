    "body": "If it is not necessary, changing the algorithm only causes mistrust. In this situation when there is a possibility that some part of the 100 TH/s (4 GB cards that mine ETH, which due to the size of the DAG file will not be able to do it from December 2020) switch to ETC, changing the algorithm to me personally looks like sabotaging ETC. Why has Bitcoin never changed its algorithm and thus piss on its miners? There are even other solutions (in addition to increasing hashrate) to solve 51% attacks (Pirlguard, checkpointing,...).                                                                         \r\n       If ETC goes Asic friendly, I am not interested anymore. I am a small GPU miner with no intention to buy Asic, I think most of the network will agree me. I love decentralization, Asic is against that.",
