    "body": "After more thought, I'm inclined to agree, however for different reasons. An average would likely result in a mediocre mid-range color with no ability to contrast well for text. It may also result in a worse outcome than present, (e.g pink on white).\r\n\r\nAlthough yes, this does affect me more due to my wimpy eyes, It is improbable that I am the only wimpy-eyed user on the network. Sunglasses are fine for some time, however their arms are often too thick, making them uncomfortable with headphones during those long ETC sessions.\r\n\r\nThe _magic_ thematic changes will support anything that supports RGB, allowing users to sync their keyboard/pc and router lighting with the ETC dark mode theme. This will be detailed more in roadmap 12.",
