    "body": "A few pending issues, for the specification:\r\n1) What block number do we set for the activation block ? Also, should activation coincide with an epoch change or should it be inside an epoch ?\r\n2) What epoch shall be the fixed/frozen epoch ?\r\n3) For programs that take their configuration from the command line, I'd like to informally proposed a common format for the option to set the ECIP-1043 parameters: `--ecip1043`=_activation_epoch_`,`_fixed_epoch_\r\n\r\nRegarding 1), I think having an epoch that is both with and after ECIP-1043 would only complicate things needlessly.\r\n\r\nRegarding 2), the possibility of bringing back 3 GB miners that have been forced to migrate/leave a bit more than a year ago has been brought up. This would still mean a significant DAG size reduction, but perhaps still imply a tolerable risk. These miners are probably on smaller coins like Pirl, Callisto, Ubiq, and QuarkChain now.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of 3) would be to make instructions to set up miners et al. more universally applicable, easing the transition.",
