    "body": "To help with ECIP-1043 evaluation and testing, I've written/adapted (on behalf of Linzhi) the following three small programs:\r\n- a cleaned-up and runnable version of the ethash.py [reference implementation](https://eth.wiki/en/concepts/ethash/ethash),\r\n- a variant extended with the ECIP-1043 change (activation and fixed epoch must be set externally to activate it),\r\n- a small pool server that can be used to test miners. This is still work in progress.\r\n\r\nCode (everything ist in Python 2.7, to keep it close to the Ethash reference) and documentation can be found here.\r\nhttps://github.com/LinzhiChips/ethash-ecip1043\r\n\r\nThe pool server speaks only the eth_getWork protocol. It can generate random jobs, change the epoch, and verifies results using the Ethash + ECIP-1043 module. This is meant to be a test tool, not intended for any sort of production use.\r\n\r\nThe pool server so far only fully supports regular Ethash. I plan to complete ECIP-1043 support in the next days. In its present shape, the pool server can be used to test the memory limits of miners, which is information that will be useful for choosing the fixed epoch.\r\n\r\nIf you encounter any problems with the Ethash implementations or the pool server, please create an issue on the ethash-ecip1043 repo, or catch me on #ecip-1043-fixed-dag.",
