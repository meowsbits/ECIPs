    "body": "So GPU minig will not work in future and ASIC/FPGA manufacturers (Mainly asia, because it's too expensive to manufacture anything decent cheaply) will take over the network hashrate while selling overpriced equipment which will be useless and e-waste if ETC does not shoot up to the moon?
