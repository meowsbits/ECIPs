I do not think so.\r\n\r\nYup, and there is your more likely 51% attack by a few large miners after ETH reaches 4 GB DAG file throwing all their hashpower at ETC.\r\n\r\nLooked at the site of HiveOS for statistics https://hiveos.farm/statistics and saw there are 50% 8GB AMD cards. Only 6% of the total hashrate was rented to Nicehash. 76% was on ETH and 2% at ETC. Everybody understands what happens when 4 GB cards cannot mine ETH anymore, but can mine ETC...",
