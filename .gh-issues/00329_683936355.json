    "body": "I want to clarify why this proposal was submitted.\r\n\r\nI am concerned with the pro-ASIC movement in ECIP-1049. I believe people are not fully addressing the concern of miner centralization and how this centralization can effect future ETC developments. We have seen ZCash's community become muted over the desires of the ASIC mining farms that are running on it now.\r\n\r\nWe saw Monero's hashrate captured by ASICs and it forced the network to create RandomX to remove the centralization risk from their hashrate.\r\n\r\nIf we stayed on Ethash, I wouldn't have drafted a RandomX proposal. But it is clear there is a concerted effort, with money behind it (ePIC and ETC Coop), to ditch Ethash and move this network to a different ASIC-friendly algorithm.\r\n\r\nI'd rather see the algorithm transition towards a more decentralized CPU mining ecosystem rather than small supply chain, centralized ASIC mining community with a laundry list of unanswered unknowns.\r\n\r\nWe have many examples of the negatives of a centralized ASIC mining community. They hijack mining ecosystems and if they don't get their way can become hostile (Bitmain & BCH fork). We are trading the risk of rental hashrate on Ethash for the risk of centralized network security on ETC's PoW. ECIP1049 centralizes the whole mining ecosystem to a small group of people, who will extract a fortune of personal wealth from the network. To me this is unacceptable and I believe we should be pushing for a much broader mining ecosystem with equipment readily available in mature and established supply chains.",
