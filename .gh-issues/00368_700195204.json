    "body": "With the fork happening after 4G cards are already ruled out on epoch 383+ I wonder how remaining miners with 6G or 8G cards will react. Usually people do not choose their own butcher - I mean here in terms of the hard hit of profitability the network will take if many 4G cards (and 3G as well) will get back active. The danger is here that 8G miners vote against the consensus change and mine on a not updated node causing a chain split. \r\n\r\nAlso I doubt that this will help much against 50% attacks, because when eth also has ruled out 4G cards likely many cards will turn of (the etc network can only be profitable for a very limited fraction of the sub 4G miners). The price determines the hashrate, not the other way around - at least as long as overall enough mining GPUs exist that could switch the network.  That said I expect only a few weeks after the action the effect of this change would be gone and the network would be attack-able as before because drawing hashrate from eth to etc would be too easy. \r\n\r\nI would rather push the efforts towards creating a new proof of work that is different enough from ethash. \r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nJust to drop a number: At the time writing the ETH network has about 60 times more hash rate then ETC. If the estimated fraction of 4G cards on both networks are true (over 30%), then already moving less then 2% of these cards from ETH to ETC could replace the complete current hashrate meaning that a centralization around some mining farms with very cheap electricity is likely. Also it is well possible, that after a minimal firmware change (inserting the right new epoch seeds) the 4G ethash ASICs might be able to continue on ETC then.  I fear this change could do the opposite of what many hope it does. ",
