    "body": "Me as a miner i have experienced most of cryptocurrency mining we see some coins turn into ASIC Friendly and every they tried to change his algo or they die in the process we don't accept that HOLDERS, GAMBLERS AND Dev want to change algo only because is easier for them because any Holders know the situation behinds a transaction confirmation no, they only care about win some satoshis on those trades that they made on binance\r\nETC Dev should look what miners need because wanted or not, we are the only supporting the mining part... i can't see any gambler or holders trying to get especialized equipment for secuiring the network because they dont care..\r\nETC Dev this is the last call for you, dont fall apart your miner community because if you change the ALGO we could easily find another home... but all ETC Network will fall into those asic chinese factory. and you will lose what decentralized ecosystem means\r\nbetter get a decent dev's and even is money is need for development guess what, miners can produce them and we can help... forget Gamblers or holders they dont love ETC... We do.",
