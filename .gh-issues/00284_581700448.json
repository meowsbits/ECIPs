    "body": "A few notes:\r\n- It seems that Parity has removed the 1.7.0 binaries (I've heard due to a security issues, im still confirming). There is a tag for 1.7.1, although im uncertain of the status since the current build is failing the CI.\r\n- I would suggest that for every week we are late to fork the fix ( ECIP-{1078,1080}) we should also delay the mainnet blocks by an equal amount of time. This is to ensure we still have the equivalent amount of time for testing.\r\n- Besu should be ready soon - but we are unsure about getting a release from Hyperledger, I'm hoping I can get a RC version\r\n",
