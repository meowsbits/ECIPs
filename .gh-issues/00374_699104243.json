    "body": "I think the proposal is broken regarding the following attack:\r\nMallory, a malicious miner (the attacker), starts mining private blocks starting from a height (x+1) where the block at height x is a common parent, but she sets her blocks timestamps for height y>x as timestamp(x)+(y-x).\r\nAll the timestamps of the attacker's blocks are 1 second apart. The difficulty in the attacker's chain increases, but this is not a problem: the attacker's blockchain will have a lower number of blocks than the honest chain, but it doesn't change the amount of hashrate the attacker needs.\r\n \r\nTherefore the attacker makes the timestamp protection in MESS 10 times less effective.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, a new rule has to be added (the rule originally described in the context of my ECIP-1096 proposal):\r\n**A best chain MUST end in the current time (minus some fixed constant, such as 5 minutes).** Let's call it the \"availability\" rule.\r\nA chain with higher cumulative difficulty that ends in the past should not be selected as the best chain.  \r\nBy doing so, the attacker must at at least one block with the current time at the end and MESS will correctly score the attacker's chain.  \r\nThe \"availability\" rule has consequences: a node that is unable to synchronize with the miners but is trapped in a partition will not be able to confirm new transactions in block received by peers, even if they are past blocks. This is, as I see it, something good.  \r\n\r\nPlease check if I overlooked something in my analysis of MESS.\r\n\r\n",
