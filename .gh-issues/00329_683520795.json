    "body": "> @gitr0n1n it seems that changing the mining algo is not a solution to 51% attacks. Instead of being `51%-overwhelmed with Ethash` we will get `51%-overwhelmed with RandomX` which is essentially the same problem.\r\n\r\nI agree that changing an algo does not `fix` 51% attacks and adjusted my proposal given that feedback. This proposal is a compliment to the current, very narrow, algorithm discussion that is being push on ETC via ECIP-1049.\r\n\r\nI believe we should be discussing the deeper topic of \"Who we want to be miners?\": CPU (RandomX), GPU (Ethash), ASIC (SHA3).",
