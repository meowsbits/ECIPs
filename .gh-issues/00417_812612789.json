    "body": "Although ~~bribes~~ donations are a natural part of any functioning governance, I feel this would extend the ECIPs Editors powers far beyond their original scope. We might be ok with the current editors having this power, but how can we be certain it will not be abused by future editors?\r\n\r\nI counter with the following.\r\n\r\nA tax is introduced to block rewards (while maintaining the current ecip-1017 emission schedule), the proceeds of which will be managed by a treasury that will oversee the construction of a Colosseum. A series of battle royal events will then be hosted, any members of the community, editor or not, can volunteer to enter. The winner (appropriately titled \"The Chad\") determines the specific color to use. These events can be cyclical every n years to ensure the color is always updated to reflect the opinion of the baddest mf in the community (The Chad), who not only gets to choose the color in question, but also manages all funds held by the treasury until the next battle royal season.\r\n\r\nThe funds use are restricted to \r\n\r\n1. Maintaining the colosseum\r\n2. hosting the battle royal events\r\n3. personal expenses of The Chad. \r\n\r\nThis is to ensure the funds are appropriately used for governing something this vital, and not siphoned off to less important areas of the network.\r\n",
