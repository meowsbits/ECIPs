See [ECIP 1092](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/327).\r\n\r\n51% attack is just a flaw of the consensus model and it can be easily addressed at protocol level with minimal efforts. There is no need to switch the mining algo or appeal to arbitrary market forces.\r\n\r\nCallisto Network is a live proof of the GPU minority chain that can definitely exist in a harsh competitive environment without getting 51% attacked.",
