    "body": "Hello, I just have to lift the opposition to the Algo change that some people wants to see here.\r\n\r\nIn my eyes, this is very clear; and i don't know who you panic and cry for a CHANGE of algo.\r\n\r\nWe have to keep in mind that a BIG part of ETH mining is ASIC rigs, we know that there are some different ASIC creators that can resume the production if its needed.\r\n\r\nWE ALSO KNOW that ETH have a thing called ProgPOW in the making, wouldnt this alone make 51% attacks nearly impossible???\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat im saying is straight forward and not hard to get.\r\n\r\nDont change algo, you will regret it. Upgrade the system to prevent 51%:s, but dont miss out on the big network change with ETH 2.0 Rollup!!!",
