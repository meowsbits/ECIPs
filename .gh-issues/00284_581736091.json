    "body": "@classiclab I did propose whether we might want to activate the Aztlan codebases in Phoenix **as well** at a block prior to 10_500_839 for ETC mainnet, but @soc1c strongly advised against re-ordering HFs in that way.   Too much risk of introducing edge cases.\r\n\r\nWith the learning that this block will likely be so much later than expected, we have done from a position to having a tight deadline of 8.5 weeks to mainnet (https://etccooperative.org/etc-phoenix-hardfork/) of having plenty of time for testing Phoenix.   The block has not changed.   Just our expectations of the date of activation.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/285 for proposed Phoenix activation time for Mordor, Kotti and ETC mainnet.\r\n\r\nWe can also start work proposals for inclusion in the following hard-fork in parallel with the extended testnet period for Aztlan+Phoenix.   The most urgent of which relate to gas-limit, gas costs, gas refund mechanism, SELFDESTRUCT and general state bloat management.   But also Kunming versioning and Keccak256 proposals.\r\n\r\nAlso, see https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pulls for the \"working set\".\r\n\r\nMaybe also FlyClient, simple subroutines?   Some Berlin opcodes?\r\nhttps://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2070\r\n\r\nWe don't need to wait until June to **start** working on plans for that.",
