All clients ignored the fork block pretty much as the state is not much populated and no transactions were executed. The major issue was not the fork itself but recovering the testnet and reorganizing from the much more heavy Agharta/Aztlan chain that already activated ECIP-1061. Once this was done and mining stabilized, I added additional Parity, Geth, and Besu bootnodes to ease discovery for new clients to sync with. \r\n\r\nAt this point, I even used old Classic Geth instances to stabilize the network because they had a much better discovery and they didn't crash during mining on low memory machines. Once everything was stable and the Phoenix chain had the higher total difficulty, I used ChainSafe's [Anemone](https://github.com/ChainSafe/Anemone) to test all opcodes live on the Mordor Phoenix testnet. As expected, the Classic Geth client is now forked off and I started forgetting that it even exists. All other clients, namely Besu, Geth, and Parity are in consensus:\r\n\r\nMordor Besu Phoenix:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2020-03-30 18:29:33.979+02:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-2 | INFO  | BlockPropagationManager | Imported #1,145,174 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0x9ee72b032718739858ebe9bd15832044684bf72d98ade75eccea383a30c4ddcd) in 0.001s.\r\n2020-03-30 18:29:41.100+02:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-1 | INFO  | BlockPropagationManager | Imported #1,145,175 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0x5942d7b038428bf310446bb4f190603893cf90418a7cc2b08fa597a35df5ca19) in 0.001s.\r\n2020-03-30 18:30:03.338+02:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-3 | INFO  | BlockPropagationManager | Imported #1,145,176 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0x87c560f3c6202b87727bde029b8d0f46e7af8998fb3bcca4a2cc4b43ee314cb1) in 0.007s.\r\n2020-03-30 18:30:07.702+02:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-1 | INFO  | BlockPropagationManager | Imported #1,145,177 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0x26afc3cf74077b3cc979c46b522678195366b14c502add6d9c5c73d68879d8a8) in 0.009s.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMordor Geth Phoenix:\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO [03-30|18:29:33.473] Imported new chain segment               blocks=1  txs=0 mgas=0.000 elapsed=46.931ms  mgasps=0.000 number=1145174 hash=9ee72b…c4ddcd dirty=439.76KiB\r\nINFO [03-30|18:29:38.498] Imported new chain segment               blocks=1  txs=0 mgas=0.000 elapsed=14.739ms  mgasps=0.000 number=1145175 hash=5942d7…f5ca19 dirty=439.76KiB\r\nINFO [03-30|18:30:00.803] Imported new chain segment               blocks=1  txs=0 mgas=0.000 elapsed=21.899ms  mgasps=0.000 number=1145176 hash=87c560…314cb1 dirty=439.67KiB\r\nINFO [03-30|18:30:06.386] Imported new chain segment               blocks=1  txs=0 mgas=0.000 elapsed=16.702ms  mgasps=0.000 number=1145177 hash=26afc3…79d8a8 dirty=439.83KiB\r\n```\r\n\r\nMordor Parity Phoenix:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2020-03-30 18:29:33  Imported #1145174 0x9ee7…ddcd (0 txs, 0.00 Mgas, 9 ms, 0.53 KiB) + another 1 block(s) containing 0 tx(s)\r\n2020-03-30 18:29:38  Imported #1145175 0x5942…ca19 (0 txs, 0.00 Mgas, 13 ms, 0.53 KiB)\r\n2020-03-30 18:29:51    14/128 peers   7 MiB chain 62 MiB db 0 bytes queue 33 KiB sync  RPC:  0 conn,    0 req/s,    0 µs\r\n2020-03-30 18:30:00  Imported #1145176 0x87c5…4cb1 (0 txs, 0.00 Mgas, 14 ms, 0.53 KiB)\r\n2020-03-30 18:30:06  Imported #1145177 0x26af…d8a8 (0 txs, 0.00 Mgas, 22 ms, 0.52 KiB)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI encourage everyone to use Mordor, send transactions, deploy and execute contracts. Or just mine it to keep the chain running for others.\r\n\r\n**Kotti** is lagging a bit behind for various reasons. Firstly, it required more coordination in the community to align all the authorities. While I was able to mainly recover Mordor on my own with a miner and a special phoenix config, we were basically waiting for client releases of Geth and Parity to happen to have a stable upgrade path for the authorities. This, however, never happened as Parity didn't do any release in the last three months.\r\n\r\nSo at some point, we were just handing out chain configurations to clients or encouraging Geth validators to switch from Multi Geth to Core Geth which had a release tagged already. This went well as all validators were very responsive and we had the recovered chain going soon after a couple of days. \r\n\r\nHowever, there was this sync-loop bug in Geth that kept these nodes trying to reorganize to the old Agharta/Aztlan chain, see https://github.com/etclabscore/core-geth/issues/75\r\n\r\nThis was a pain for Kotti validators because if more than three validators ended up in this sync loop at the same time, the network was stuck and this happened quite a couple of times. There are patches in place now to stabilize the authorities and for a couple of days, this network is running fairly stable. \r\n\r\nIt's not on Phoenix yet, still on Agharta. ETA: April 13, 2020, if the validators do their job correctly ;)\r\n\r\nKotti sees much more activity in general, the state is much bigger and the chain is much busier. I'm looking forward to seeing Phoenix activated on Kotti and run additional tests on that network, too.\r\n\r\n**Morden** finally died.",
