    "body": "> Although almost ever comment seems to be in opposition to this ECIP, I'll add my own reasons to the discussion.\r\n> \r\n> * This is obviously contentious. And it is a hard fork. That makes it the most dangerous type of change.\r\n> * It does not solve the 51% attack problem in any viable way. The only argument I given for this was \"modifies ethash enough to invalidate hashrate available on nicehash\". This argument involves a specific company (who by the way could easily add the  feature) A cryptocurrency's security cannot rely on what a single company's feature set may of may not currently be.\r\n\r\nIf ECIP 1099 did not have much support it would not currently be in accepted status.\r\n- This is a very simple change that is easy to implement and that does not introduce anything new compared to what currently exists. The goal is to keep the existing 4 GB hardware and to attract new ones that soon will not be able to mine ETH. The right place to discuss contentious hard fork is ECIP 1049 which is 1000 times more expensive and harder to implement safely and FAIRLY. Don't be hypocritical here.\r\n- It solves the 51% attack problem as follows. 4 GB cards are currently represented by 48% of all cards (source: https://hiveos.farm/statistics/). Due to the dag size increase ETH will soon be left without 120 Th/s. If, for example, only 40 Th/s pass on the ETC it will make it much more resistant to 51% attack. Especially considering that an attacker, due to MESS, will need 31 times more hashrate than before to carry out a 51% attack. It is logical to expect that these 40 Th/s will directly mine ETC, without Nicehash, as they are currently directly mining ETH. Taking this fact into account and the fact that MESS has been implemented, this greatly reduces the danger of Nicehash and thus the worry of whether Nicehash will have an etchash button.\r\n\r\nAn increase in the hashrate will affect the price increase because then investors and miners will buy the ETC instead of mining it 10 to 15 times longer then now due to the increased hashrate.
