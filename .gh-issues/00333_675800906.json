    "body": "Is it possible to implement a hybrid PoW / MN system where the masternodes are in charge of verifying that the longest chain reported is congruent with the longest chain of the majority?\r\n\r\nif we have 100 nodes reporting identical chains and we receive the notification of a longer chain that is \"unique\" then the other 100 chains should ignore this false chain\r\n\r\nit's possible ?\r\n(I do not agree with the algorithm change due to the events scheduled for the next 2 years, this would affect miners who made investment in equipment to support the network, it would be to turn their back on those who have been supporting ETC for years)",
