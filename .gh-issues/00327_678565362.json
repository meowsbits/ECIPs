    "body": ">So it's not as if it has not gotten attention. Just some food for thought as you complain about a lack of attention.\r\n\r\n### I'm not complaining about the lack of attention, but I am totally against censorship.\r\n\r\nI am a longtime contributor of the project. I came up with a solution and a team capable of implementing it in no time. I followed all the contribution guidelines. Then I asked for a **quick announcement of my proposal because I originally proposed it as a temporary solution that could be implemented in a soft-fork and calm down exchanges, pools and users to give us the time we need to carefully evaluate long-term solutions.**\r\n\r\nHowever it turned out that someones employee has a little bit of power in an important part of the project and he has exploited all his control to censor my proposal because he does not personally like me for some subjective reason.  This goes against the benefit of the project and the community. This goes against the core principles of the project and the Crypto-Decentralists Manifesto.\r\n\r\n>**Neutrality is necessary.** It’s important for anyone participating in\r\nblockchain-enabled cooperation to be on an equal footing with everyone else. It doesn’t matter if you wield huge economic power or only a tiny amount. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a saintly Mother Theresa or a vicious drug dealer. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a human or a refrigerator. It doesn’t matter what you believe in, what political theory you subscribe to, or whether you’re a moral or immoral person. A participant’s ethnicity, age, sex, profession, social standing, friends or affiliations, make or model, goals, purposes or intentions — none of this matters to the blockchain even a bit. The rules of the game are exactly the same for everyone, period. Without neutrality, the system is skewed towards one set of participants at the expense of others. - [A Crypto-Decentralists Manifesto](https://medium.com/@bit_novosti/a-crypto-decentralist-manifesto-6ba1fa0b9ede)\r\n\r\nI was constantly asking for an explanation of the reasons behind not announcing my proposal. The aforementioned employee openly refused to answer my question, showed extreme incontinence, used curses and profanity. This is a cruel violation of any [professional ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_ethics#Programming_Ethical_Guidelines).\r\n\r\nIf IOHK has 10x the resources and produces 10x more content than me, so they get 10 announcements versus my 1 announcement, then that's okay. But please, when I have something important to announce - do not censor it on purpose even if you don't like me.\r\n\r\nAfter that, I insistently asked to provide the github issue link but not the pull request in the announcement. Most of our [Callisto security auditing workflow](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Auditing#callisto-security-department-workflow) is handled through Github and we have performed more than 300 security audits there so we have a great expertise in understanding user experience when it comes to using the github platform. I'm absolutely sure that most of the users never want to get to the [pull request](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/337) when they follow the proposal link. Instead they want to get to the [human-friendly proposal description and the following discussion](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/327). As a result, many (potentially valuable) contributors will leave ECIP without participating in the discussion if they are redirected to a pull request that does not provide any valuable information about the proposal and only serves as a place where developers can validate the submitted proposal.\r\n\r\nIn the [recent announcement](https://twitter.com/eth_classic/status/1296876629830950912) that was finally made the Pull Request link is provided instead of issue link. This is counterproductive.\r\n\r\nAfter all, once the employee made the announcement, he did it wrong. The mistake is that he provided two links to ECIP 1092 but no link to [ECIP 1094](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/340) which is also referred in the announcement.\r\n\r\n### I'm happy that the issue is resolved.\r\n\r\n**I'm not calling anyone by name on purpose.** I believe that our internal conversations and disagreements should stay internal but not related to this ECIP and I hope that such a censorship and unprofessional counterproductive behavior will never happen again.\r\n\r\nI wish him to be careful, because next time he might make a bigger mistake because of emotion. The project can be seriously damaged if the account is compromised as a result of a human mistake and someone scams thousands of people on behalf of the project using an “official” account.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the recent events I would like to re-open an old [Decentralized on-chain registry of media resources](https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/issues/93).\r\n\r\n",
