As a minority chain in a large compatible hashrate market, ETC is experiencing regular 51% attacks.

Can anyone from the pro-SHA3 side address this concern of extreme centralization?\r\n> \r\n> How could it be more centralized than repeated 51% attacks?\r\n\r\nIt could be 100% network attacks by one company controlling this entire side of the ecosystem from manufacturing equipment to mining the network. This is not a solution to 51% attacks at all. It is a recommendation to jump to a more \"cryptographically secure algorithm\" than Ethash. but it has massive negative externalities associated with that change.\r\n\r\nThe author himself is cited that this is not a solution to 51% attacks and rejects ECIP-1049. But has somehow put up this proposal. It is very strange. https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/13#issuecomment-461387800",
