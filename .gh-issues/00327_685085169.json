    "body": "So i went trough the code and its really simple: \r\n\r\nIf you are offline miner you cant join the network and do the reorg because of the penalty.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense because if you mine offline and dont interact with the network than WHT* you are mining? \r\n\r\nIf you do mine offline it has sense you want to prepare just an attack and thats all... what else you do? \r\n\r\nExpample of penalty:\r\n\r\nLets say you wanted to mine 5 blocks in private (offline) and now you want to sync them to real online network:\r\n\r\npenalty = (1 + 1) + ( 1+1+2 ) + ( 1+1+2+3) +( 1+1+2+3+4)  + ( 1+1+2+3+4+5)\r\n\r\nso for you to mine 5 offline blocks you need to mine 41 online blocks\r\n\r\nI dont think it has anything to do with \"nakomoto ideas\" as it seems it does penalty only to the actor that wants to dmg the network...\r\n\r\nWith last attack it would be insane number... \r\n\r\nwith that even 60 comfirmations on exchanges would be okey and safe as the penalty would be simply to big. (Can be bigger for start...)\r\n\r\nBut it would be much lower than 80.000 that some exchanges have now ðŸ’¯ !\r\n\r\nMaybe its better to agree on some small reorgs like is in original code: \r\n\r\nSmall reorg are tolerated using this params https://git.pirl.io/community/pirl/-/blob/master/params/protocol_params.go#L147 as it can happens with network latency or other events related to the nature of the connection ",
