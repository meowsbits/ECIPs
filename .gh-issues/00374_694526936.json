    "body": "> block times over the last ~2 million blocks is 59 seconds\r\n\r\nThe last 2 million have been boring. I was thinking of the dao split times. The head staleness check was what i was talking about and would require an incredibly unlikely heist to accomplish(but this is blockchain). \r\n\r\nI was imagining a longer term, more coordinated attack where an adversary spent some time mining honestly with >2/3 the total network hash to increase the total difficult. At the time they choose, they could remove miners from mainnet (leaving it with a difficulty that would be near impossible for 1/3 the hash rate) and produce the reorged chain.  Since the honest miners would take longer to produce a block than usual than, the staleness check would default to the reorg chain.  \r\n\r\nThat being said, It is extremely unlikely that it would be possible unless the attacker was Danny Ocean. MESS will solve the problem it sets out to accomplish. \r\n\r\nIf were adopting it as a 'best practice', I think you should make the assertion of the general principle first. It has been a missed opportunity in the past or we just assumed it was implied by adoption. Accepting an improvement proposal means that the community accepts the idea as a core value; \r\n - limited supply(monetary policy), \r\n- no forced changes(bomb removal), \r\n- gas cost shouldn't be abused (gas cost changes for IO-heavy operations) ((this one needs to be revisited aka gastoken)) \r\n- feature parallel to eth for tooling is desired(recent forks)\r\n- contracts should comply to standards(status codes)\r\n\r\nIt should be silly that anyone would assert that etc doesn't have or know its \"core values\" since that the purpose of ecips are clarifying these values. \r\n\r\nalso +1 for integer math.
