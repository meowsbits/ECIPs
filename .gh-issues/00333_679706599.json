    "body": "We are looking to give anyone who champions a proposal their own meeting to avoid rushing through, and allowing them enough time to explain their potential solutions and help stakeholders understand by also taking questions.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken to IOG (fmr. IOHK) to set up their meeting for next week, awaiting on exact date. If we could remove them from the agenda that would be much appreciated. \r\n\r\nAlso in last week's meeting we did not agree with moving forward discussions about implementing Random X. Why are we now adding it to Friday's meeting? There's no one championing it, nobody on last week's call, and not enough information about its practicality in the ETC ecosystem. You can see what went down in the action items from last week's call [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f0a0sqb0OW3n4ki6nM3q9hvJ91HeZoj9Rpjp2fDCZIQ/edit).",
