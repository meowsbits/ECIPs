    "body": "There is very little practical difference between a 51% attack and a 100% attack. Both allow arbitrary depth reorgs and theft from other users. The only effective defense against 51% attacks is to be the majority chain for a specific hardware compatibility group. Bitcoin is the majority sha256d ASIC. Ethereum is the majority GPU chain. Your choice is to continue being 51% attacked every few weeks until ETC is dropped by exchanges and other services, or to switch the algorithm to try to become the majority chain in a new ASIC",
