    "body": "When someone write TBD. It gives participants a heads up that a meeting is coming and to expect a date/time sometime later. It seems like we are making concessions on behalf of one individual who failed to read the agenda last week and attend the meeting.\r\n\r\nThese meetings aren't being sneaked around so that certain people don't show up thats just ridiculous. @q9f has done fantastic jobs setting up and leading thees calls. Besides that Ronin is the champion for the RandomX proposal. I've seen no other supporters for RandomX but Ronin. It's not anyone's fault but their own for missing a meeting. ",
