    "body": "The behavior of this change has been modeled on the callisto network and a similar implementation has occurred on Horizen. What you are describing is a non-existent obstacle based on a demand for comparison via ethereum classic test nets. This is wholly unnecessary, indeed a waste of resources and man hours, due to the existing network which has already implemented these changes that can be accessed by utilizing callisto. Callisto is itself a fork of ethereum classic, which could be arguably seen as a testnet.\r\n\r\nIf you want to compare PirlGuard to MESS, then compare the callisto network and the mordor test network. The precise model you desire already exists in the Horizen implementation, with multiple studies conducted on the efficacy of these changes: https://github.com/anneouyang/horizen/blob/master/README.md\r\n\r\nNo write up or description is going to change the protocol from what is already described. If you wish for a comparison to a separate model, the burden is on you to describe the problem and test a solution. ECIP-1092 is a solution that is easily explained and incorporated quickly without wasting hours on test nets and developing a system similar to what has already been successfully integrated elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNone of what you describe is necessary. You voice what you would like and expect others to react when you do not put forth effort to answer your own questions. Stop wasting time.",
