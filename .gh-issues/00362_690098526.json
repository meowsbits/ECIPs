    "body": "**ECIP-1043:** Just some findings regarding the DAG size.\r\n* ethminer 0.17.0 on my 4GB Radeon RX 470 is limited to epoch 351 (3.74GB)\r\n* claymore 15.0.0 on my 4GB Radeon RX 470 is limited to epoch 351 (3.74GB)\r\n* teamredminer 0.7.10 on my 4GB Radeon RX 470 is limited to epoch 382 (3.98GB)\r\n\r\nThe theoretical possible limit should be epoch 383 (3.99GB), however, we didn't manage to find a miner that is capable to actually deal with that.\r\n\r\nCurrent epoch is 372 (3.91GB) at the time of writing.\r\n\r\nSo we have a soft limit of around 351 and a hard limit of 383. Therefore, we already entered the critical phase of DAG size.\r\n\r\n> B: (current spec) stop growth at block 10,000,000 (DAG is about 3.6GB then)\r\n\r\nThis really needs to be updated. It looks like this is no longer a viable option.\r\n\r\n_Edit:_ and block 10M passed a while ago. We should freeze on epoch 382 which starts on block `11_460_000`.",
