    "body": "> Perhaps the biggest tweak we could consider here, though, is to go full bore SHA3, rather than Keccak256, which was a historical accident for ETH, and add a SHA3 precompile too.\r\n\r\nThe main reason I would suggest keccak256 is that ETH has keccak256 support. This would allow cross-chain header verification while SHA3 would not. For PoW the concerns are (roughly in order)\r\n\r\n1. Does any other chain use the hash function?\r\n2. How cheap is it to verify?\r\n3. How many other chains can verify it?",
