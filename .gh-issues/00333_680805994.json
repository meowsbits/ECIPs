    "body": "> For meeting two this Friday - we likely have to split it up. There is no way we will meaningfully get through all of those topics. We're gonna set ourselves up for failure.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean @developerkevin - we only have three agenda items.\r\n\r\n> Also in last week's meeting we did not agree with moving forward discussions about implementing Random X. Why are we now adding it to Friday's meeting?\r\n\r\nIt appears you are reading the agenda from last call. RandomX is not on the agenda.",
