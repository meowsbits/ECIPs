    "body": "> ECIP-1043 only leaves ETC still vulnerable to attacks, the whole point of the hard fork is to change that.\r\n> \r\n> Hard forks are a security hole in themselves, you can't go hard forking as if it were a walk in the park. To solve the fundamental problem of ETC's 51% vulnerability the only option is to move to sha3 (ECIP-1049 + 1095) ASAP.\r\n> \r\n> Whether miners come or not is dependent on the payment per block and the certainty they assess that they will actually get that payment as opposed to being reorg'd all the time as it's happening now.\r\n> \r\n> A change to sha3 is not a \"reset of the ecosystem\", it's only a legitimate mining algorithm change given the obvious vulnerability and real life attacks ETC is suffering.\r\n> \r\n> [the above is an opinion I wrote on discord so I post it here for the record]\r\n\r\nI don't know how you can look at Hard Forks as an attack vector, but completely overlook the centralization of the entire mining ecosystem to one small company (EPIC Blockchain). @TokenHash I believe you're blinded by your love for the ETC Coop guys personalities.\r\n\r\nThis proposal solves none of ETC's immediate problems today. The rollout will be well over a year and you will land in the hands of one little centralized group. If that is the path you'd like to take, by all means pursue it. That will be a NEW PROJECT with NEW CORE PRINCIPLES. ETC will continue to move on with its current algorithm and current core principles; without your forked chain and its disruptive participants during a chaotic time in the network's history.",
