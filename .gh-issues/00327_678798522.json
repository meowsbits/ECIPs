    "body": "I will answer you specific responses:\r\n\r\n> This is not an issue of PirlGuard in first place. Then \"isolating a node with PirlGuard\" is as hard as \"isolating a node without PirlGuard\". So the complexity of the attack is literally the same.\r\n\r\nThe problem is not with defending the node from eclipse attacks but dealing with the aftermath of eclipse attacks.\r\n\r\nIn the case of PirlGuard, you cannot rely on the longest chain rule, as it comes down to the local (subjective) state of the network.\r\n\r\n> Finality is not subjective. It is simply governed by new consensus rules, which are certainly objective, but to some extent dependent on the previous state of the network. Unlike the current consensus rules that assume that the network could be shut down and then resumed at any time. However in reality the network is never shut down and we can remove these redundant mechanics from the consensus.\r\n\r\nIt is subjective because it does not rely on an objective point of reference -- i.e. the longest chain based on Proof of Work.\r\n\r\nPirlGuard is subjective because it relies on the state of the network from the point of view of the node; it is literally subjective. \r\n\r\n> Naturally long partitions never happen. You can point me out any example since 2009 if you have any. I'm not aware of any natural chain splits for the past 11 years. Prevention of such chain splits is the main goal of the network and all the complex underlying mechanics because this splits would make the network unusable.\r\n\r\nI don't have enough information to prove whether or not this happens, but lack of it happening doesn't prove that it can't happen.\r\n\r\nIt may be the case that it only doesn't happen because there's no incentive to have this kind of attack. It may be that it would only happen when a large market cap chain implements a consensus protocol that incentivises this attack.\r\n\r\n> In case of a successful eclipse attack a node or a group of nodes may be definitely isolated and it will never sync with the mainnet chain again. However this would not happen if some of this nodes have a whitelisted private connection with another distanced node to compare with.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, but can we guaruntee this? Can we also guaruntee that those whitelisted nodes cannot be censored or DDOSd? Could an attacker not partition the network in a way that maintains some of these whitelisted connections? Could a state actor partition the network for 60+ blocks?\r\n\r\nThese are all additional assumptions about the security model that we don't have to worry about now, but will be introduced with PirlGuard.\r\n\r\n> If the cost of the attack is not known and taking control over the 100% of the nodes of the network is not possible even in theory then the attack has little to no chance of success.\r\n\r\nThis assumption is incorrect. You don't need to take control of 100% of the nodes; you just need to partition the network temporarily.\r\n\r\n> The economics and ideological background of 51%-attacks are absolutely the same from what we can observe in the past history of our projects. These are the same at the present time.\r\n\r\n> There is no reason to assume that economics and politics are different in case of this attack.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, I disagree because the incentive to do an attack on ETC is greater and requires relatively the same resources. The risk/reward is higher, and it might be worth waiting to execute this 0-day attack if you can get a greater payout. It may even be easier to pull off on ETC because it's network is larger, more decentralized, and therefore easier to partition.\r\n\r\nThe politics are clearly different because ETC poses more of a threat and is disliked by more people than other smaller chains.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the market cap metric matters because by sabotaging the ETC network it is easier to open short positions that do not effect the price of ETC due to having a highly liquid market.",
