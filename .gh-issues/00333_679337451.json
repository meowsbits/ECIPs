    "body": "Hey @q9f, For meeting two this Friday - we likely have to split it up. There is no way we will meaningfully get through all of those topics. We're gonna set ourselves up for failure.\r\n\r\nI think and others agree that we should give those proposing these solutions, a meeting of their own to explain and help us understand and take questions before we make any decisions or even have a debate. I'm going to speak to IOG (Formerly IOHK) to see if / when they're available. But no doubt this Friday's agenda won't work and will likely end up like the last meeting imo.  ",
