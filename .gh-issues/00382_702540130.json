    "body": "For the record, let me repeat something I proposed a while back on discord: given that ECIP-1049 is now being mainly justified as being an anti-51% measure, and that we have 1) ECIP-1099 coming, which will provide a) a band-aid and b) is expected to substantially increase ETC hash rate over the next months, plus 2) it seems that MESS will be deployed as a specific anti-51% measure, the 51% risk may reduce dramatically.\r\n\r\nConsidering that ECIP-1049 is likely to drive away most of the current ETC miners, and is criticized by many, it would therefore be advisable to refrain from rushing any commitment to ECIP-1049 deployment. Specifically, I'd suggest to defer the decision of whether to move ECIP-1049 to \"Accepted\" until March 2021. By that time, we will know i) whether ECIP-1099 will have resulted in the return of current 4 GB ETC miners, who will be briefly excluded by the DAG crossing 4 GB before ECIP-1099 activates, ii) whether 3 GB miners will have returned to ETC, and iii) whether the 4 GB crossing of ETH that is expected to occur in December 2020, will have resulted in 4 GB miners previously mining ETH to switch to ETC. Furthermore, we will iv) have a few months of operational experience with MESS.\r\n\r\nIf the turnout of i) through iii) should be low, and possibly iv) be unsatisfactory, the proponents of ECIP-1049 would have a far easier time to justify the need for such a major change to the ETC ecosystem, and avoid further conflict or even a split of ETC into competing coins.\r\n\r\nNote that anyone planning to make ASICs for ECIP-1049 should be largely unaffected by delaying this decision. They can perform the steps that require minimum investment, i.e., the design of the chip logic, and even backend, and still have enough time to start the capital-intense production and have their chips ready for the projected introduction date of ECIP-1049 if such a switch should be decided in March 2020.",
