    "body": "I object to any changes to the DAG file creation by for example as it is proposed now. In the past no change was made to let 1 GB cards mine, no change was made to let the 2 GB cards mine, no change was made to let the 3 GB cards mine. \r\n\r\nSo now no change can be made to let the 4 GB cards mine after the DAG file size exceeds their on board memory. It is an attack to the ETC blockchain itself what grew organic and has to be maintained as it was intended.\r\n\r\nIf you want to change it, you should hard fork to a new coin and let ETC evolve and continue as it did.\r\n\r\nThinking that an 51% attack has less chance when the 4 GB and 3 GB cards can mine ETC is false. The biggest miners have asics with 4 GB memory or GPU's with 4 GB memory. Letting the DAG file size grow as it does brings back decentralisation towards smaller miners who have GPUs with 6 GB and up or the latest big miners with asics with over 4 GB memory; the latter are a minority as far as I know.\r\n\r\nThe big miners mine ETH in mayority and they will switch to ETC only when they cannot mine ETH anymore. ETC will be flooded with hashpower at that point and the miner fee will plummet and the price of ETC too I guess. The result of the proposal will be that the small miners cannot compete with the large mining farms because of the electricity cost. This will lead ETC to be more prone to a 51% attack, because of this economy of scale: read centralisation. \r\n\r\nIf you want ETC to survive you have to let the DAG file grow organically as it does untill now and not interfere with it. That way it is worth to mine ETC for small miners and this will keep ETC more decentralised as when you go back in time with your DAG file size and have all todays hashpower trown at you because all those AMD GPUs with 4 GB just suck in mining other coins not based on the ETHash protocol as well as the ASICs with 4 GB memory.\r\n\r\nETC is Ethereum Classic, forked from original ETH. It uses EThash with a DAG file. The DAG file size is within 2 months of reaching 4 GB. At that size a lot of GPU's and ASICs will be obsolete. \r\n\r\nA 51% attack is less likely to happen when it is expensive. We are so close to make the cost more expensive and you want to throw that advantage away? It doesn't make sense at all.\r\n\r\nA mining rig with 8 RX5700XT can hash 500 MH/s. A new InnoSillicon A10 with 5 GB can hash 500 MH/s too, if I'm not mistaken. New AMD GPUs are to be introduced with probably better hashrate and efficiency. New NVidia GPUs are just introduced and performing better. So GPU's are still competitive as ASICs are not that much cheaper, especially when the resale value of GPUs is taken into consideration. The ASIC is a doorstopper when the DAG file exceeds its onboard memory and GPUs prices are quite good till now. So ASICs have no real advantage over GPUs. Same price level and cost is the best ASIC resistance there is.\r\n\r\nBetter let it be for the moment and let's see what happens after all 4 GB GPUs and ASICs become obsolete for ETC. This will happen before they become obsolete for ETH, so you can see what will happen to ETC hashrate and ETH hashrate and the consequences for difficulty, price and miners reaction, how traders react to the new conditions and so on. In this case ETH gets all the hashpower from obsolete ETC miners thrown at them. If you make the DAG file smaller you get all the hashpower of obsolete ETH miners thrown at ETC. ETH hashrate is 243,55 TH/s while ETC hashrate is 3,01 TH/s according to www.whattomine.com as I write this on 29 september 2020 at 15:10 UTC. Can ETC handle and survive all that hashpower from ETH when a large portion of miners can not mine ETH anymore, but can mine ETC? I think it will be devastating for ETC, especially because it makes a 51% attack easier than it is today.",
