    "body": "I object to any changes to the dag file creation by for example as it is proposed now. In the past no change was made to let 1 GB cards mine, no change was made to let the 2 GB cards mine, no change was made to let the 3 GB cards mine. \r\n\r\nSo now no change can be made to let the 4 GB cards mine after the DAG file size exceeds their on board memory. It is an attack to the ETC blockchain itself what grew organic and has to be maintained as it was intended.\r\n\r\nIf you want to change it, you should hard fork to a new coin and let ETC evolve and continue as it did.\r\n",
