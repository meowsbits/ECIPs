    "body": "I object to any changes to the DAG file creation by for example as it is proposed now. In the past no change was made to let 1 GB cards mine, no change was made to let the 2 GB cards mine, no change was made to let the 3 GB cards mine. \r\n\r\nSo now no change can be made to let the 4 GB cards mine after the DAG file size exceeds their on board memory. It is an attack to the ETC blockchain itself what grew organic and has to be maintained as it was intended.\r\n\r\nIf you want to change it, you should hard fork to a new coin and let ETC evolve and continue as it did.\r\n\r\nThinking that an 51% attack has less chance when the 4 GB and 3 GB cards can mine ETC is false. The biggest miners have asics with 4 GB memory or GPU's with 4 GB memory. Letting the DAG file size grow as it does brings back decentralisation towards smaller miners who have GPUs with 6 GB and up or the latest big miners with asics with over 4 GB memory; the latter are a minority as far as I know.\r\n\r\nThe big miners mine ETH in mayority and they will switch to ETC only when they cannot mine ETH anymore. ETC will be flooded with hashpower at that point and the miner fee will plummet and the price of ETC too I guess. The result of the proposal will be that the small miners cannot compete with the large mining farms because of the electricity cost. This will lead ETC to be more prone to a 51% attack, because of this economy of scale: read centralisation. \r\n\r\nIf you want ETC to survive you have to let the DAG file grow organically as it does untill now and not interfere with it. That way it is worth to mine ETC for small miners and this will keep ETC more decentralised as when you go back in time with your DAG file size and have all todays hashpower trown at you because all those AMD GPUs with 4 GB just suck in mining other coins not based on the ETHash protocol as well as the ASICs with 4 GB memory.\r\n",
