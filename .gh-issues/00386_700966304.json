    "body": "I think some of the main takeaways to this **informational ECIP** is that these \"training wheel\" proposals should have some point of removal specified in their ECIP. Otherwise they could theoretically be there on nodes forever, just unused, even after hash rate hopefully returns and the network returns to normal.\r\n\r\nI understand that MESS and others have certain points that must be met in order for them to 1. turn  on and 2. turn off but I think putting a time limit on them with an option to renew is a better way forward.
