    "body": "An \"eclipse attack\" is just a sybil attack with a fancier name.\n\nWhat does ideological beef mean? EXP launched before ETH Classic became a\nthing and there are plenty of people that hate EXP just for existing. We\nhave had people that try to disrupt the network just because of past\nmembers of our dev team.. ie me.. james clayton and others. Ideological\nbeef is basically an alias for EXP. And so far finality, although not a\nmagic bullet, has helped us stem off of those attacks because at the end of\nthe day, if they can only reorg 60 blocks at a time, the economy is never\nreceiving a shock. At most tx's would be delayed, not double spent. Delayed\ntxs are an inconvenience, double spends are catastrophic. We can deal with\ninconvenience, but catastrophe is costly. Finality adds peace of mind to\neconomy participants.\n\nOn Wed, 19 Aug 2020 at 06:07, Chris Hitchcott <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> I wanted to raise another potential issue with the PirlGuard appraoch, and\n> open up discusson on how the network would handle eclipse attacks.\n>\n> Some background on eclipse attacks here:\n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss6VmIxGrBk\n>\n> As far as I understand, with PirlGuard, an eclipse attack (or an eclipse\n> attack + 40% attack) would do extra damage to the network compared to not\n> having PirlGuard in place.\n>\n> My impression is that the subjective finality that is added with PirlGuard\n> would, in the case of a long network partition (either by natural disasters\n> or an eclipse attack), permenantly splitting or fragmenting the network\n> (because of the reorg cap).\n>\n> This type of attack wouldn't be about trying to profit from a double\n> spend, but instead trying to create havok, perhaps in the hopes of\n> manipulating the price of ETC with leveraged short positions, or simply for\n> ideological reasons without a profit motive.
