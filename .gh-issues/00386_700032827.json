    "body": "What's the purpose of this document? And how do we benefit from this bundle? What role does EIP-1099 play?\r\n\r\nAnd - this is my personal opinion - why do you believe - out of all proposals - that we need on-chain governance to make Ethereum Classic progress in future? We have proven that Classic is alive by planning and executing 3 protocol upgrades in the last 12 months and we are about to finalize the 4th. How would locking ETC and voting on chain help with progress? I personally believe this is just distraction. Also, do we know who the main ETC holders are that would rule the chain in future?",
