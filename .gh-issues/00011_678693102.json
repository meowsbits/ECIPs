    "body": "If an ethash card can only mine ETC and not ETH, is that an ETC network positive? e.g.; ETC DAG 2GB and ETH DAG 4.1 GB, so any card under 4.1gb ETC would be the majority chain for those cards. Effectively ETH 1.x DAG begins the Ethash miner equipment capture now if ETC DAG is lower than ETH. It's a minimal change compared to other options being discussed that could have a large impact on providing static Ethash hashrate. I'm just thinking through this option out loud. I could be incorrect in my logic, feel free to correct me. I also likely haven't thought through the unintended consequences of this adjustment. But that appears to provide an ETC-centric solution, rather than relying on other blockchains to secure the ETC network.",
