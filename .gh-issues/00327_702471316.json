    "body": "If you are interested in testing the security, why not attempt to break Callisto? The resources required to build a separate test network which includes PirlGuard would probably cost more than what would be required to test your proposed attack vector on Callisto.\r\n\r\nWhat I see from both @phyro and @wpwrak is a lack of personal responsibility for your accusations. Neither of you are willing to put forth effort into creating a formal definitions of neither ECIP-1092 nor your criticisms of PirlGuard. All you have are speculation and requirements which you are unwilling to meet.\r\n\r\nYou say this code is not functional, yet you are unwilling to test it nor put your money where your mouth is and attack the Callisto Network.\r\n\r\nSince you are unwilling/unable to prove the dysfunction of Callisto, I say we move ECIP-1092 forward unless detractors decide to quit being cheap cowards and break Callisto with their proposed attacks.",
