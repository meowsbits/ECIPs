    "body": "Its single chip ([data sheet (XC7K325T)](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/selection-guides/7-series-product-selection-guide.pdf#K7)) with controller for ~$200 and it runs on 50 watts. 1000 x difference doesn't seem to add up. I want to keep it on topic but I think a big part of getting this right is having a good open source implementation that people use. People will surely use this one thats 100x faster, which is a problem because it's not open source, it only works with a pool, *and it taxes a cut of the mining reward for the FPGA developer*. They can do all this by publishing only the compiled binaries.\r\n\r\nWould it maybe be less work to try and reverse engineer the reward tax out of this instead of building from scratch? Do you know anyone who could do that? What would that kind of think cost?",
