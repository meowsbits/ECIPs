So many positives for the network.\r\n\r\n+ 3GB card moving to ETC in November\r\n+ 4GB card moving to ETC in December\r\n= increase in lower bound hash rate.\r\n\r\nETC APEX chain for these lower capacity cards = Big network security appreciation.\r\n\r\nLikely a positive for price appreciation as well with long term miner capture. Great proposal @iquidus !",
