    "body": "> > In other words, what effect would MESS have on the total hash power needed for the attacker to appear as the preferred chain for a particular victim or subset of victims, assuming the attacker can eclipse them at will?\r\n> \r\n> If the attacker can eclipse anyone at will, they don't need much hash power at all, since the victim(s) will never see the honest chain. This is the same with or without MESS.\r\n\r\nIf a victim is eclipsed forever then that's right, but if the victim can be eclipsed for a shorter time span (I.e for a few days) then MESS changes the amount of hash power required by the attacker to keep the victim from reorging back to the honest chain right? \r\n\r\nIn other words:\r\n\r\nScenario A: Without MESS attacker that eclipses an exchange needs X hash power to control which chain the exchange sees as the real chain. \r\n\r\nScenario B: with MESS the attacker that eclipses the exchange needs Y hash power on a decreasing slope up to 1/31 of the global consensus chain? \r\n\r\n> > Does MESS reduce the global (e.g affecting all participants) vulnerability to attackers with temporary access to hash power at the expense of increasing local vulnerability (e.g affecting a single participant)\r\n> \r\n> Yes, MESS exacerbates the symptoms of the eclipse attack _upon the conclusion_ the attack. Instead of immediately recovering to the honest chain, the victim(s) will require that the honest chain has 31x+ total difficulty over their local segment, which is the segment the attacker has fed them.\r\n\r\n1) For how long would an exchange need to be eclipsed to reduce the hash power required by an attacker feeding a dishonest chain to an exchange to 1/31 of the honest chain? \r\n\r\n> 2)  It should be noted, however, that this demand establishes a minimum value for the attacker's segment which is greater than it would otherwise be.\r\n\r\nI don't understand. Could you please elaborate a bit?  Thanks! \r\n\r\n> \r\n> > Since the proposed gravity is a wave function,\r\n> \r\n> It isn't a wave function. The ceiling plateaus.\r\n\r\nGot it thanks. So after the plateau the local chain is preferred over other chains as long as it has 1/31 of the hashing power?\r\n",
