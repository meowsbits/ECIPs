    "body": "I would ask who is creating the asics. As from our miners experience there is \"asic\" mafia and even big miners have problems to recive asics in time. Specially if it will be limited. We also need to consider if by removing main component of networks (GPU miners) it will have good impact and what other changes it might bring. We also did study and i dont opose fact that if you are majority chain on that algo its much better than to be minority on Ethash, but .... who can say that you for sure will be biggest? Maybe you will be biggest on start and than in 1 year same stuff will repeat? It doesnt solve the problems we have now and it seems super complicated solution for problem that seems is possible to solve by eicp 1092 and 1097, 1043.",
