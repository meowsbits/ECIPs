    "body": "> So GPU minig will not work in future and ASIC/FPGA manufacturers (Mainly asia, because it's too expensive to manufacture anything decent cheaply) will take over the network hashrate while selling overpriced equipment which will be useless and e-waste if ETC does not shoot up to the moon? Who mines for no-profits jus to secure the etc network?\r\n> \r\n> This sounds like a really bad plan, from miner perspective.\r\n\r\nThat is why this is being pushed on the network by some rouge developers in the \"SHA-3 Coalition\" as they call themselves. It's not very well thought out. However, once they make this split they will have full control of their own chain (not the original) and not have to deal with decentralized development that comes with Ethereum Classic.\r\n\r\nNo surprise it's backed by someone from the Ethereum Foundation (Trojan Horse). Literally pulling an Ethereum Foundation (DAO Fork) and securing it with a Bitcoin Segwit2x New York Agreement approach. Not to mention they pushed this when the network was at its weakest during the 51% attacks while FUDDING the ETC chain. If that doesn't scream bad actors, I don't know what does...\r\n\r\nBest of luck to them",
