    "body": ">I'd appreciate if @SonnyRollins#5183 takes the concerns of his ECIP-1049 proposal seriously. These could have a crippling effect on the mining ecosystem for ETC. I can take the snarky lumps right now, but lets turn these topics into material discussions to seriously iron out the path forward. Supply Chain is absolutely a huge component we need to talk about. Sub topics: Cost of hardward, life of hardware, availability, potential supply chain bottle necks, chip manufacturing capacity. So many unknowns that have me worried this change will result in a very small amount of miners left on ETC.\r\n\r\n>cc: @DonaldMcIntyre#8877 to rethink his position. Deep thought on logistics needed here from a bright mind.\r\n\r\n>DundiditToday at 1:53 PM\r\n@r0n1n another variable is time for activation of the change.  How long will miners be able to prep if new equipment is required.  The lead time for procurement is quite difficult for small cap miners.  If there was a wholesale coop where the grass root miners could come together to form a bargaining block (dear say a union :face_vomiting:) to help us procure equipment more efficiently and rapidly.\r\nGranted that last comment is beyond the scope of the ETC network leaders but this is the mining channel.",
