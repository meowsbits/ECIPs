    "body": "ECIP-1043 only leaves ETC still vulnerable to attacks, the whole point of the hard fork is to change that.\r\n\r\nHard forks are a security hole in themselves, you can't go hard forking as if it were a walk in the park. To solve the fundamental problem of ETC's 51% vulnerability the only option is to move to sha3 (ECIP-1049 + 1095) ASAP.\r\n\r\nWhether miners come or not is dependent on the payment per block and the certainty they assess that they will actually get that payment as opposed to being reorg'd all the time as it's happening now. \r\n\r\nA change to sha3 is not a \"reset of the ecosystem\", it's only a legitimate mining algorithm change given the obvious vulnerability and real life attacks ETC is suffering.\r\n\r\n[the above is an opinion I wrote on discord so I post it here for the record]",
