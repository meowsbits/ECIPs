    "body": "> I will answer all questions that are presented to me on the call, but I am too busy to answer everything posted in the comments. My apologies.\r\n\r\nGreat @antsankov I am compiling every unanswered question for your team to address during this 9/11 Q&A on ECIP-1049. Right now I count 27 questions (https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/8 , https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/13 , https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/342), some are multi-pointed questions though. So we should schedule a substantial amount of time for this review as it is not my intent to dominate the entire conversation, but to give your proposal a thorough review for the general public to digest the full ramifications of what you're pushing on the network during these chaotic times.\r\n\r\nI've posted two large lists of the questions in the `ecip-1049` and `ecip-1095` channels in discord and pinged you. Please read through those questions prior to the meeting so you're not caught off guard and can adequately address every concern on the call itself. They were sourced from these SHA3 threads (https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/8 , https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/13 , https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/342).\r\n\r\nWhile I heavily disagree with your proposal and will be there to represent the vocal opposition, I'm looking forward to learning how your team has addressed the abundant criticism of ECIP-1049 in detail. Thank you.",
