    "body": "> Haven't you considered reducing the DAG epochs? In about a month, DAG epochs will be too big for a 4GB GPU.\r\n\r\nThis is described in ECIP-1043. Implementing ECIP-1043 would also change the DAG, and thus be one of the \"weak barrier\" changes I mentioned earlier. Implementation considerations:\r\n1) the change itself is fairly simple. Establishing a timeline would need input from the developers of mining and client software.\r\n2) all clients (miners, pools, etc.) have to be updated, which would be a bit of work. Assessing the complexity of this task would again need input from the developers, who'd also know how easily they can push changes to their users.\r\n3) an easy deployment scheme would assume that a given program \"foo\" would then become \"foo-etc\", and differ from \"foo\" in a) implementing ECIP-1043 and b) not implementing Ethash without ECIP-1043. If the ability to use the same program for Ethash with ECIP-1043 and the original Ethash is needed, then some integration work would be necessary. This is likely to be the most complex part of the change.\r\n\r\n(Note that points 2 and 3 apply to the implementation of any proposal that changes the PoW, no matter by how much or how little.)\r\n\r\nDIsclosure: while all this are largely my own thoughts, I should mention that I work for Linzhi (Ethash ASIC maker), and point 3 below is significant for us.\r\n\r\nEcosystem impact:\r\n1) 4 GB miners can continue mining ETC for the foreseeable future (eventually, power efficiency will obsolete them),\r\n2) 4 GB miners are not required to make an investment decision on whether to upgrade their GPUs in the next weeks,\r\n3) a-bit-more-than-4 GB miners (e.g., some ASIC miners) will also be able to mine ETC for the foreseeable future,\r\n4) miners with plenty of memory would continue mining as before (but still need to update their software),\r\n5) assuming that ETH does not implement ECIP-1043 or similar, some miners are likely to move from ETH to ETC when ETH crosses their memory barriers (4 GB and higher),\r\n6) assuming mining profitability doesn't change much, ETC would be the most profitable coin for Ethash-type mining with equipment whose memory limit is below ETH's DAG size,\r\n7) due to the PoW difference, it would no longer be possible to switch Ethash hash rate from ETH to ETC (unless the miner(s) in question implement ECIP-1043 as well, and the entity coordinating the switching of hash power also supports such a switch of PoW variant).\r\n\r\nThe mining profitability argument is important, since it encourages miners to be \"loyal\" and not support actions that substantially lower the value of ETC.\r\n\r\n> This will result in (in my opinion) a fairly sharp drop in the hashrate for ETC.\r\n\r\nIf https://hiveos.farm/statistics is any indicator (it's a bit hard to interpret the results since many categories are combined in one value), the ETC hash rate coming from 4 GB cards may be substantial.\r\n\r\nWhen the 4 GB barrier is reached on ETC, and ECIP-1043 is not implemented by then, miners will have to decide whether to\r\n1) invest in hardware with more memory,\r\n2) switch to a different coin, with a lower DAG size or a different GPU-friendly algorithm,\r\n3) stop mining entirely.\r\nMy guess would be that most will take option 2, mainly switching to ETH, which will give them some more months, and then scatter in all directions.\r\nChoice 1 is only likely to be taken on a large scale if there is a strong statement from the ETC community that PoW changes that would weaken the competitiveness of current Ethash miners are neither likely nor on anyone's agenda. Currently, the opposite is true.\r\n\r\nThere may be additional considerations I didn't think of.",
