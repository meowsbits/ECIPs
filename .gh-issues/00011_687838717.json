    "body": "It woul d be good if we could compile a database of real-life memory limits of ETC mining hardware. Of special interest would be to know the last epoch popular miners with 3 GB and 4 GB can mine, GPU and also ASICs. The pool server I mentioned in the previous comment can be used for this:\r\n\r\n- clone the repo and start the pool server in \"quick\" mode, for example,   \r\n  ./pool.py -d 32 -e 250 -q 9999   \r\n  would start the pool server in \"quick\" mode (no verification of results) on port 9999, with the epoch set to 250, difficulty to 32 bits.\r\n- direct your miner to stratum+tcp://foo@your-pc:9999   \r\n  (\"stratum\" refers to the protocol using eth_getWork. May not be called the same on all miners.)\r\n- you miner should now request a job and start mining. The pool server will show its network traffic on the console.\r\n- you can change the epoch by entering the following commands on the pool.py console:\r\n  `epoch N`   \r\n  `job`   \r\n  `epoch N` sets the epoch to the specified decimal value. `job` sends new jobs to all the miners that are connected.\r\n\r\nAfter determining at which epoch your miner runs our of DAG space, please report the following, either here or on #ecip-1043-fixed-dag:\r\n- the highest-numbered epoch at which you could still mine,\r\n- the nominal memory size of your mining hardware,\r\n- manufacturer and model name of your hardware,\r\n- the operating system you're using,\r\n- the mining software you're using, and its version,\r\n- whether the hardware is used exclusively for mining, or whether the machine is also used as a desktop and only part-time mines.\r\n\r\nThanks !",
