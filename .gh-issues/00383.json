ECIP-1100 \"MESS\" offers a way to increase the finality rate without tampering with existing \"hard\" chain consensus functions or characteristics, and to do so with minimal negative side effects.\r\n\r\n- Proposal: [ECIP 1100: MESS (Modified Exponential Subjective Scoring)](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1100)\r\n- Read more: [Agreeing To Disagree: Proposing a Weakly-Subjective Finality Solution for Ethereum Classic](https://medium.com/etc-core/agreeing-to-disagree-proposing-a-weakly-subjective-finality-solution-for-ethereum-classic-7daad47efc0e)\r\n- Discussion: #374 \r\n- Bonus: [MESSnet TV](https://mess.canhaz.net) - Visualization of an ad-hoc Classic testnet implementing MESS.\r\n\r\n_We encourage all parties, especially other ECIP authors, to participate and ask questions._",
