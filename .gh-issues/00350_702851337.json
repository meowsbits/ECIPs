    "body": "Thanks for writing the proposal. I have a few questions regarding\r\n> - 20% goes to the p-ECTS smart contract address or the burn address (0x0)\r\n\r\nI'd first like to explain why I think that sending to the burn address in this case may be very different than a user sending to the burn address. If I have 10 ETC and decide to send it to `0x0` then that's fine because it is as if I mistakenly sent the coins to an address that doesn't have an owner and never will have one (unless someone breaks the discrete log, but we can assume this won't happen). In this case, the coins existed and had an owner that sent them to void. The situation is very different if the miners decide to send 20% of the reward to `0x0`, because the coins **never had an owner and never will**. I think this is the same as the coins never existing. Yes, I'm hinting that it could be (and suspect it is) a change to the Monetary policy. A counter argument could be \"well, you can see the coins on the chain, they're there and you can count them\", but the important difference which makes them the same as the ones that don't exist is that they can't ever have an owner. Coins that are not on the chain and don't exist have exactly the same usage properties as the coins burned by the miners. The miners never _send_ them to `0x0`. They can't _send_ because they never own them, they only decide whether the coins will exist in the treasury contract or they won't exist at all.\r\n\r\nRight now, I'm of the opinion that this changes the Monetary policy. If we treat these coins as never existing, does this change the miner incentives regarding their treasury decision?",
