    "body": "If there are no technical limitations, which I do not see, I think it is better that the dag epoch instead of lasting twice as long (x2) lasts x3 or x4 (as much as possible). I don't see any technical obstacles to the epoch lasting instead of the planned 8, say 16 days. The correction is trivial - put x4 in the code instead of x2. The reason I suggest this is that itâ€™s not nice, nor professionally good for business and customer engagement, to artificially deny someone with weaker hardware to mine if they want to. It is much more natural and normal for people to stop mining on their own when it is no longer profitable for them, and that does not necessarily mean that it will be in 3 years. As we can see from the empirical evidence that the hardware from 3 years ago is still profitable.",
