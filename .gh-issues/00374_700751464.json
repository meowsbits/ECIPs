    "body": "> In other words, what effect would MESS have on the total hash power needed for the attacker to appear as the preferred chain for a particular victim or subset of victims, assuming the attacker can eclipse them at will?\r\n\r\nIf the attacker can eclipse anyone at will, they don't need much hash power at all, since the victim(s) will never see the honest chain. This is the same with or without MESS. \r\n\r\n> Does MESS reduce the global (e.g affecting all participants) vulnerability to attackers with temporary access to hash power at the expense of increasing local vulnerability (e.g affecting a single participant)\r\n\r\nYes, MESS exacerbates the symptoms of the eclipse attack _upon the conclusion_ the attack. Instead of immediately recovering to the honest chain, the victim(s) will require that the honest chain has 31x+ total difficulty over their local segment, which is the segment the attacker has fed them. It should be noted, however, that this demand establishes a minimum value for the attacker's segment which is greater than it would otherwise be.\r\n\r\n> Since the proposed gravity is a wave function, \r\n\r\nIt isn't a wave function. The ceiling plateaus.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45600330/93938960-aee75180-fcef-11ea-83bb-3f0c57df5abf.png\" width=400 />",
