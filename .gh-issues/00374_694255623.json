    "body": "Thanks for your feedback!\r\n\r\n> edge of eternity attack\r\n\r\n:joy: I \"invented\" this term to describe cases of (even semi-...)permanent bifurcation caused by `n vs. n-1` (or otherwise \"close\") state discrepancies, with adversaries targeting that \"edge\" to force one set to an \"eternal\" disagreement.\r\n\r\nAnd the variable-hashpower balancing strategy is indeed among the most significant risks I see, though given the degree of random variance in honest hashpower it seems like the attacker would have at least a non-trivial challenge.\r\n\r\n> floats in the consensus-layer spec definition\r\n\r\nYou're right -- integers to the rescue! This issue hadn't occurred to me as a  _critical_ one because the algorithm's \"weak\"ness permits marginally inexact gravity measurements (anticipating variances in last-known state anyways). With that said, though, I think it would be worth refactoring for nice round numbers (and protocol consistency), and your cubic looks fine to me. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
