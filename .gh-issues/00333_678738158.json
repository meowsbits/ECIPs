    "body": "> @wpwrak Werner, mind championing and drafting a proposal?\r\n\r\nSorry, I haven't answered that one yet. The proposal for one of the three approaches I've outlined - ECIP-1043 - has already been on the table for a while. I'd consider the other two (seed value change and Ubiq-like change of the cache generation algorithm) less desirable, since they both lack the life extension for 4 GB miners (and I'm assuming that such a life extension would have an overall positive effect.)\r\n\r\nApart from the life extension, changing the seed value or implementing ECIP-1043 would mean nearly the same amount of development work. Work that would be dwarfed by the effort needed for integration and deployment anyway. The seed value change scenario has value as a thought experiment since it reduces the change to a conceptually necessary minimum, so it doesn't detract from pondering the other implications.\r\n\r\nI'd consider the Ubiq approach not any more desirable than a seed value change because it would accomplish the same, while requiring more effort (including making sure ETC doesn't copy Ubiq too closely and become a possible threat for them.) However, Ubiq serves as an example of an implementation of this class of weak barriers that is used in the real world, which is why I mentioned it.\r\n\r\nMost of the relevant arguments for or against ECIP-1043 already seem to have been made. I'm just adding the observation that it also provides a weak barrier against hash rate switching, which makes it relevant for the discussion at hand.",
