    "body": "> This is also unprofessional and I have reported the content. I will ban the drd34d account if this continues. zero tolerance for bullying.\r\n\r\nUhhh, I'm being reported. You banned Wei for defending himself but you didn't ban me? Waiting from the director's order to ban me? (hi bob!)\r\n\r\nWhere was your \"zero tolerance\" for bullying when bob, afri and 2 other kids were trying to ban Wei on the false pretense of doxxing afri, in order to silence his opposition to the issues found with the fork AND the call notes? \r\n\r\nWhere's your \"zero tolerance\" for lies and bullying like this just now:\r\n\r\n> A discord vanity address costs around $1000 per year. That's a phishy tactic trying to squat that name, misleading users to believe this is an official representation of the Ethereum Classic community. \r\n\r\n**This github is only a show off for ETCG holders to justify their premiums,**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereumproject is far gone and the 'lemmings' don't care **why**. \r\n",
