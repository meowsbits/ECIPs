    "body": "At least for Nvidia cards I see that total wattage per hash is not that different.  My gtx 1050 ti cards with 4gb of ram max out at 75 watts a piece typically stable in the 60 watt range.  My newer 2070 supers with 8 gb are drawing 215 watts.  Cost of operation for equivalent hash rate is almost the same.\r\nThe biggest thing that prevents me from mining ETC even with my 8gb cards is that I cannot find an exchange that will accept deposits at the moment due to the August 51% attacks.  Which means from an earning perspective ETC has no liquid value for miners.  You can buy and trade ETC within the exchange you just cannot deposit your mining income.\r\nHard to attract miners when the earnings are inaccessible.",
