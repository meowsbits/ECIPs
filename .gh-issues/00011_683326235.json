    "body": "i have submitted a revision to the ecip to clarify the implementation to allow for the widest number of graphics cards while still computing the dag. After the mahic dag freeze block, every epoch will be epoch 42.  #356 \r\n\r\nRecommended Implementation\r\n\r\nTwo variables directly control the dag size growth cacheSize and datasetSize \r\n\r\n - cacheSize is the size of the ethash verification cache that belongs to a certain block number.  The cache size grows linearly, however, we always take the highest prime below the linearly growing threshold in order to reduce the risk of accidental regularities leading to cyclic behavior\r\n\r\n - DatasetSize is the size of the ethash mining dataset that belongs to a certain block number. The dataset size grows linearly, however, we always take the highest prime below the linearly growing threshold in order to reduce the risk of accidental regularities leading to cyclic behavior.\r\n\r\nThese values are calculated as blockNumber / epochLength. To set the dag growth to a number smaller than what would occur through the normal calculation. A Magic Dag Epoch block is of `64` replaces `blockNumber / epochLength` as the epoch number after the fork block and when the dag is calculated in the future this epoch is always used. Dag generation is uneffected and both cache and data size. \r\n\r\n```\r\n//run prior to calculating cacheSize or dataSize \r\n if (blocknumber > ECIP1043Transition) {\r\n\t\tepoch := 64\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\tepoch := int(block / epochLength)\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
