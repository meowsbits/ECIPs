    "body": "At second glance it seems the Berlin hard fork is not implemented in Ethereum: https://twitter.com/JHancock/status/1351519606590955522?s=20\r\n\r\nSo, it seems a non-urgent hard fork for ETC, especially when considering there are historic proposals native to ETC that seem to have higher priority and have been there for a long time. \r\n\r\nSuch proposals are:\r\n\r\n- Keccak 256\r\n- Proto Treasury\r\n- Flyclient\r\n- NiPoPoWs\r\n- Checkpointing\r\n\r\nOn the other hand hard forking every six months is not advisable for any base layer chain. Hard forks should be reserved to very important upgrades, especially key to ETC, like the ones mentioned above that have been relegated for too long.\r\n ",
