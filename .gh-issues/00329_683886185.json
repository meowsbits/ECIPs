Below is a list of helpful videos that document how the transition from CryptoNight to RandomX worked out:\r\n- A recap right after the hard fork by Red Panda Mining: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjgD6GZpXeQ\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Hashrate immeditely tripled with the change to CPU from CryptoNight\r\n- Mining profitiability dropped with the increase in hashrate\r\n- supply chain: readily available CPUs on the market. A big improvement from the ECIP-1049 proposal \r\n- Many miners already have CPUs sitting around, low investment needed for miner to support the ETC network under RandomX.\r\n- Software available to dual mine RandomX and Ethash. To retain GPU mining participants.\r\n\r\nThis algo will allow anyone to participate in the Ethereum Classic mining ecosystem. Here is an example of a RnadomX home build:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/ARJlaWAZjcw\r\nJune 2020 RandomX Results: https://youtu.be/Z_CxGoEt1_o",
