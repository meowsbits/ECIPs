    "body": "For this proposal, we have the benefit of observing the Monero networks adoption to this alogrithm. Below is a list of helpful videos that document how the transition from CryptoNight to RandomX worked out:\r\n- A recap right after the hard fork by Red Panda Mining: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjgD6GZpXeQ\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Hashrate immeditely TRIPLED with the change to CPU from CryptoNight (ASIC exploited). That's a positive for network security.\r\n- Mining profitiability dropped with the increase in hashrate. This appears to have normalized over time, but that was the immediate effect due to the sharp rise in hashrate.\r\n- Supply chain: CPUs are readily available on the market. There is a well established supply chin for this algorithm. This is a big differentiator from the ECIP-1049 proposal. Where the supply chain is very small and CENTRALIZED. Think: ASIC front running via manufactures like Bitmain!\r\n- Many miners already have CPUs sitting around, so its a low investment costs to onboard more miners to support the ETC network under RandomX. This is a positive for network security.\r\n- Software available to dual mine RandomX and Ethash. Our current GPU miners can migrate to CPU while still utilizing their current GPUs. This is a win/win and could set that stage for a gradual transition from Ethash to RandomX opposed to the immediate algo change that Monero did.\r\n\r\nThis algo will allow anyone to participate in the Ethereum Classic mining ecosystem and is in the spirit of a DECENTRALIZED mining ecosystem. No one in the SHA3 camp is acknowleding how the move to ECIP-1049 will highly CENTRALIZE ETC mining. This gives those actors far too much power and we will eventually have a BTC/BCH contentious fork down the road with that centralized mining entity as it tries to retain its monopoly on the ETC inflation.\r\n\r\n\r\nScroll youtube for RandomX material, there are so many videos out there now that it's been about a year since Monero switched to this algo.\r\nHere is an example of a RandomX home build:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/ARJlaWAZjcw\r\n\r\nJune 2020 RandomX Results:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Z_CxGoEt1_o",
