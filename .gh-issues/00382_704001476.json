    "body": "This mining algorithm change has never been touted as a solution against 51% attacks. It's impossible to solve against such attacks. It instead helps mitigate such attacks by making ETC the \"apex predator\" in the Keccak/SHA3 realm. This algo change would benefit the network in many ways such as faser node validation, faster sync times, and more efficient mining. GPUs would still be able to mine SHA3/Keccak, as would FPGAs. However, to again reiterate, Keccak was never meant to solve 51% attacks. ",
