    "body": "It has also occurred to me that I am the author of both the specification and implementation.  As such, I'm happy to tell you that your critical assumption _\"Core-Geth's code really is the specification,\"_ which is the basis of points 1-3, is actually backwards. The Core-Geth implementation is derivative of the specification. As such, the specification's license (Apache 2) [may be safely applied](https://www.apache.org/licenses/GPL-compatibility.html). \r\n\r\nIf you find the quotations of Core-Geth code in the specification -- which are intended for use as illustrative and exemplary purposes only -- problematic from a licensing level, please file an issue at this repository documenting the concern and describing the rationale. Provided a valid and sufficiently documented argument to that concern, I would be more than happy to remove or modify those citations as needed.\r\n\r\n",
