    "body": "* GPUs\r\n\r\nAlready heavily centralized, enough to the point that one could rent some hash-power and attack ETC.  changing from one GPU algorithm to another will not fix this problem, people rented hardware-time, not algo-time.  They could easily (if not even easier) rent enough hardware to attack the new GPU algorithm.\r\n\r\n* FPGAs\r\n\r\nIronically, the FPGA supply-chain is actually the least centralized out of all hardware (cpus, asics, gpus).  Vast majority if FPGA mining is done with recycled chips from 2-3 years ago, hundreds of vendors in China, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia have access, and there's a very healthy market of supply and demand that keeps one party from dominating.  The main manufacturers of these chips do not supply the mining market for two key reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst off, FPGA performance improvement per tech-node is not 10x or 20x like with ASICs.  A 28nm FPGA goes toe-to-toe with a 16nm FPGA. Secondly, COGS for higher tech-node chips is higher than the market sale price of recycled chips.\r\n\r\n* ASICs\r\n\r\nGiven that it will be 1 year before this change hits the network, there's plenty of time for one or two ASIC manufacturers to mass produce an ASIC for ETC.  Shuttles (small runs) of 28 - 40 nm chips typically take 5-6 months to complete, after which mass production is a given.  The main risk however is the fork, which is an uncertainty that dictates how much of the network follows ETH, and how much follows SHA.  ASIC vendors may back out or hesitate given this risk.\r\n\r\nWould love to be involved with the technical discussions.  ",
