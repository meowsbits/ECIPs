    "body": "Also it is worth to reference my Security Auditing DAO proposal that was rejected because it required Treasury: https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/231\r\n\r\nI would like to correct @bobsummerwill and @meowsbits comments.\r\n\r\n>Auditing is a good idea, but should not be centralized into the block rewards.\r\n\r\n>Agree to Reject on grounds of centralized system services. Don't want to spend any time on it at any meeting.\r\n\r\nThe proposed auditing system is intended to be a DAO governed by a smart-contract. The proposed system must allow security auditors to enter, leave, pick tasks and get paid based on the quality of work done at any time. \r\n\r\nThis is not centralized as it is not tied to any trusted authority that can not be removed. Not really more centralized than [McAfeeDEX](https://mcafeedex.com/#/erc20) that is a smart-contract or [ENS](https://docs.ens.domains/) that also relies on a smart-contract.\r\n\r\nIn presence of the Treasury system proposal I would like to notice that I'm still capable of building such a decentralized security auditing core system in any project that has built-in governance/funding mechanic.\r\n\r\nHere is ECIP-1052: https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/blob/master/_specs/ecip-1052.md\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the proposed system is abstracted from Treasury implementation so it can be used alongside IOHK Treasury model. I would like to hear any feedbacks on this.",
