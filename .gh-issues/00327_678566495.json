    "body": "> from what I've seen on the Checkingpointing and Timestamping system of IOHK, I'm not a fan of the idea of relying on a separate federated chain to secure ETC. So this proposal appears to be the most logical solution I've read thus far.\r\n\r\nAfter I  investigated the IOHK Checkpointing proposal, I came to the conclusion that it does not interfere with ECIP 1092 and both proposals can be applied at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis would probably be the best option.",
