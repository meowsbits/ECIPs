    "body": "Although almost ever comment seems to be in opposition to this ECIP, I'll add my own reasons to the discussion.\r\n - This is obviously contentious. And it is a hard fork. That makes it the most dangerous type of change.\r\n - It does not solve the 51% attack problem in any viable way. The only argument I given for this was \"modifies ethash enough to invalidate hashrate available on nicehash\". This argument involves a specific company (who by the way could easily add the  feature) A cryptocurrency's security cannot rely on what a single company's feature set may of may not currently be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
