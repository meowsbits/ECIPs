    "body": "> Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Charles' 1 week timeframe was related to garnering community support for an embedded treasury system.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what I took from the video. Ideas he presented were possible solutions on how the situation could be improved. I did not take them to be what he was suggesting as part of the 1 week to decide. Maybe this needs to be two separate ECIPs:\r\n\r\n1) Short-term solutions to resolve network issues\r\n2) Community support for an embedded treasury system with a 1-week decision timeline",
