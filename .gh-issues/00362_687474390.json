    "body": "perhaps you would rather it be 9/10? or the monday following 9/11?\r\n\r\n9/10 is a bit tight of a timeline for the 51% attack proposals though. Are you sure that is enough time for the general public to digest these topics? The last thing we want to do is rush proposals and have inefficient meetings as you have vocally stated. So let's keep that in mind to keep this a productive meeting. Thanks!\r\n\r\ni think 9/25 is a good time as that is plenty of time for the public to become aware of the meeting and the 51% attack proposals will have been able to hold thier presentations.",
