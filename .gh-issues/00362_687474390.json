    "body": "Perhaps you would rather it be 9/10? Or the monday following 9/11? Some people might be mourning the death of loved ones, the scheduler made the decision to honor their mourning and the date was adjusted within 24 hours from being posted. I believe that was an empathic decision and I appreciate him for that. So we should likely just keep moving on here and discuss the agenda for 51% attacks as that is the pressing issue for the network. \r\n\r\nBut to entertain your thoughts and opinions, outside of the human element of this scheduling:\r\n9/10 is a bit tight of a timeline for the 51% attack proposals. Are you sure that is enough time for the general public to digest these topics? The last thing we want to do is rush proposals and have inefficient meetings as you have vocally stated. So let's keep that in mind to keep this a productive meeting. Thanks!\r\n\r\nPersonaly, I think 9/25 is a good time as that is plenty of time for the public to become aware of the CDC meeting for large attendence and sufficient time to digest the 51% attack proposal presentations.",
