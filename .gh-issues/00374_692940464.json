    "body": "> the same as if they were attacking the safety window in mess\r\n\r\nCan you say a little more about what you have in mind here? Do you mean the \"external safety mechanisms\", like the minimum-peers condition or the head staleness check?  Otherwise, the feature I like most about MESS is that it doesn't have a discrete window (ie rough edges). The attacker needs to maintain a near-constant competing difficulty ratio, and if they fail that, the probability of network resolution rises near-exponentially with each next block (on either chain).  Kind of like walking a tightrope that starts to slope up quite quickly.\r\n\r\n> I think the longest block time on the network were shorter than what is proposed though.\r\n\r\nI hope so! :joy: From my statistics, the 99th percentile of ETC historical block times over the last ~2 million blocks is 59 seconds, so I doubled that. \r\n\r\n",
