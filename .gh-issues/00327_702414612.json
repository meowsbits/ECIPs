    "body": "I agree with @wpwrak. This isn't specific to PirlGuard though, this should be done for _any_ serious change. I think any change to the core and especially the consensus should be shown secure either by proving it or by convincing people that the simplicity of the change and enough eyes will be good enough - even though the code change is 100 lines, it's far from clear to me what side-effects PirlGuard can cause to the system. In both cases, you need a framework to reason about the change and some sort of a formal spec is a great way to do that. If we don't do the research and keep introducing important changes that have very little research behind, we'll eventually make the network explode because we will miss new cases they introduce. Of course, since we're not the size of Bitcoin, we can't rely on having every change come from a peer reviewed research paper, but it needs at least a bit of rigor and some mathematical description. As was mentioned above, there needs to be some modeling of the state and description of the system variables that the change can affect. Dropping a `.go` file and saying \"it works on a tiny network\" is not sufficient in my opinion. I'm not a fan of any kind of subjectivity in the consensus, but if I compare MESS and PirlGuard proposals, there's a very big difference in the amount of work that was put into the ECIP and the analysis of the solution.",
