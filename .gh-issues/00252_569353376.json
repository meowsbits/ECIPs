    "body": "From @bobsummerwill \r\n1. Outreach ASAP for voluntary gaslimit reduction (to stop the bleeding)\r\n2. Counter-measures against gaslimit (buying tokens) to try to reverse the damage.\r\n3. Potential protocol changes\r\n\r\nAnd those protocol changes could include:\r\n\r\n1. Gas price changes\r\n2. Removing opcodes (remove refund opcode, remove selfdestruct)\r\n3. Hard cap gas and curve (my pending ECIP) to give multi-decade certainty.\r\n\r\nACTIONS ITEMS:\r\n- Blog post on https://ethereumclassic.org/ by @zacmitton explaining the situation and appealing to miners to voluntarily reduce gaslimit.  To 1M?  To 2M?  To 4M?\r\n- Outreach on the above (using existing contacts we have used for prior HFs)\r\n- Volunteers to generate pull-requests against Parity-Ethereum, Geth Classic, MultiGeth and Hyperledger Besu which change the defaults for ETC to the same.\r\n- Volunteers to consider countermeasures to reverse as much of the damage-to-date as we can by buying gastokens (using community fund if this is expensive) and then using them to debloat the chain.\r\n- Volunteers to consider protocol changes for the long-term.\r\n\r\nFrom @hitchcott \r\nright now [...] you can spam an entire full block for (7M gas * 1000 gasPrice) = 0.000000007 ETC or $0.0000000315 USD (if my math is correct)",
