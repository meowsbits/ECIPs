    "body": ">There is never a time where the added weight of the longest or heaviest\r\nchain is worth the 1000+ reorganization. Ever. The economic damage that\r\nhappens from such a reorg is also a cost.\r\n\r\n@chrisfranko is right. \r\n\r\nThere is no such situation at which a huge reorganization is necessary. Huge reorganizations never happen naturally - these are already an abnormal behavior of the network.\r\n\r\nIf such a split would naturally happen then some exchanges would be damaged already. This would be a disaster for the network. In practice this never happens. Only attacker can exploit this \"feature\" of the protocol to harm the network and participants.",
