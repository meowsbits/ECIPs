    "body": "> Lately I've noticed quite a lag in approving some of the pull requests that need approval so we can move forward. This seems to create a sort of backlog PRs and/or issues.\r\n> \r\n> I'd nominate myself to be an editor and create a PR if there's still a need for another one, though the proposed editor additions PRs still need to be approved by two.\r\n\r\nI will gladly resign my nomination to give you the opening. It looks like I will be quite busy with school this semester anyways and only want what is best for the ETC community/project",
