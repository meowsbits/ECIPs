    "body": "Again, if some party is a multi node entity and it has nodes at both chains `A` and `B` then this party can deterministically decide which chain is correct. \r\n\r\n**Because the chain split happened at block n+60 and it is possible to determine which chain includes a better block A(n+60) or B(n+60).**\r\n\r\nThis entity can whitelist the correct chain for the node that suffered network latency issues and failed to sync with the correct chain before it downloaded the next block and it was too late to reorg the chain.",
