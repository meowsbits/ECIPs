    "body": "@knocte \r\n\r\n>ETC is selling itself as a more conservative alternative to ETH: by keeping PoW, by not having infinite inflation (like the 1st blockchain: BTC). Deploying this would go completely against this narrative\r\n\r\nThe chain that has good narrative and ideology but does not work is worthless.\r\n\r\n>this looks like a very experimental thing (has any other blockchain adopted this?)\r\n\r\nThis is adopted by Callisto, PIRL, Expanse and other networks. Please, read the ECIP text again.\r\n\r\n>given that ETH is switching to PoS very soon\r\n\r\n**IF** ETH is switching to PoS ever. There were plans to migrate to PoS at the very start of Ethereum in 2014. Then in 2015. Then in 2016 and 2017 and in 2018. In 2019 this should have certainly happened. Now in 2020 ETH is going to switch to PoS again... now they even have a PoS testnet. \r\n\r\nAlso, ETH should have a decentralized file system called SWARM which also had a testnet. In 2018 iirc. Nothing happens so far.",
