    "body": "I haven't used this pseudonymous account for years, but I just want to jump in and say that I find the attack and toxicity of @realcodywburns, @gitr0n1n and `@longsats` on Twitter against Ethereum community, OpenEthereum team and @sorpaas disgraceful.\r\n\r\n@gitr0n1n I don't find anything wrong in the \"proofs\" you are accusing against @sorpaas. Everyone are entitled their own opinions. What's wrong with @sorpaas opposing Phoenix hard fork? The reason is also something as important as immutability from your link. https://consensus.corepaper.org/wiki/Contention_of_Phoenix_(new)\r\n\r\nI can ask @sorpaas whether he's willing to give up the https://discord.io/ethereumclassic domain, but I don't see that a big problem. Do you own the \"Ethereum Classic\" trademark?\r\n\r\nI wrote MultiGeth and later gave it to @sorpaas for maintanence. Ellaism Core fully supports @sorpaas' decision of removing ETC support. For ETC refugees, please consider joining the Ellaism community! Ellaism has fixed total supply, no pre-mine, stays in POW and is in feature parity with Ethereum Classic.",
