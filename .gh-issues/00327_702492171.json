    "body": "@padenmoss, you seem to mistake the concerns phyro and I are raising as some extravagant obstacles we put up due to some hostile attitude. Be assured that this is not the case. You are likely to encounter similar requests any time you propose changes of protocols that are used on a larger scale. The purpose of such requests is not to shoot down a proposal but to better understand it and to ensure it does not introduce new major issues.\r\n\r\nRegarding effort, I offered two weeks ago on the ecip-1092-pirlguard channel to help with drafting such a specification. After one positive response, the rest were all negative.\r\n\r\nI agree that a test net would be an unsuitable tool for such analysis. That's why we use models and simulations. Test networks are good for shaking out relatively easy to find implementation and interoperability issues, but simulations let you create precise conditions, reproduce experiments, and add whatever instrumentation you find useful. But before you can simulate, you need a model.\r\n\r\nThanks for the pointer to Horizen ! This is the first time I saw this mentioned. And yes, also a compact implementation in the constrained environment of a simulator could be a basis for a specification.",
