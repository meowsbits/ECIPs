    "body": "> curious why isn't ProgPOW back on the docket, it'd seem a little like low hanging fruit as a stop gap algo change. I think most clients have it implemented ?\r\n\r\n@zcstarr it was rejected Zane, but you are free to to champion it. I think there is a process for reviving rejected proposals. If you want to prepare something, could you please look up the meeting minutes from November where we rejected it and why?\r\n\r\n@crazypool2019 thanks for raising your concerns. on this call today we will make no decisions and just discuss the technical potential of each of the proposals.\r\n\r\n> I would suggest to also consider PoW changes that leave the hashimoto algorithm (the \"core\") intact but change the PoW results through using a different DAG, similar to how Ubiq achieved some degree of separation from ET*. \r\n\r\n@wpwrak Werner, mind championing and drafting a proposal? Keeping Ethash at the core is actually a desirable thing from a technical perspective if we just could diverge it enough to prevent Ethereum miners to jump the network.\r\n\r\n> I ve invested 18'000 us to support ETC by purchasing Innosilicon A10 Master Pro 5g\r\n\r\n@stoweo112 changing the algo, in case we decide in favor, will take a while, so you will be able to mine ETC with your 5G for at least another half a year before the changes affect mainnet. thanks for securing the network!\r\n\r\n> Please could we get the first meeting, on Thursday 20th, moved a few hours later?\r\n\r\n@bobsummerwill Bob, I'm sorry, my son has a soccer match afterwards. I scheduled this call to be inclusive for eastern timezones and next week we have a call for western timezones. I hope you can make it anyways :pray:",
