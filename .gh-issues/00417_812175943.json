    "body": "Personally I'm in favor this. I find it clearly innovative, relevant, and firmly in line with the foundational principles of the network and community. \r\n\r\nHowever. I must admit to a small concern with the color candidates proposed for the democratic nomination. Despicable, pallid, mute, lifeless tones. I would urge the community to consider more vital and expressive hues like \r\n- the warm and earthy #060a09\r\n- a timelessly modern #0f0f1a\r\n- an austere, but comfortable #120f0f\r\n \r\nAlthough I am sure I could offer at least 46 further alternatives superior to what my obviously style-less colleague has described, it occurs to me that the voting procedure might stake a bold claim toward democracy and its better brother, anarchy, if the voting contract were to allow for _arbitrary hex encoded values_ to be submitted, and then for those submissions to be averaged to derive the final collective result. \r\n\r\nIn order to best mediate this frontier democracy, I further propose that the theoretical contract weight the bespoke votes by an associated ETC stake (sums obviously reclaimable in their original total by their senders after voting is finalized). A specification for this might be taken almost verbatim from the p-ECTS proposal; though in the original, this specification requires 1/3 of the total supply of ETC to be staked to achieve a quorum,<sup>[1](1)</sup> I would suggest reducing this parameter to a more modest 1/300000000 of the total supply in this case.<sup>[2](2)</sup>\r\n\r\nPlease find below additional references related to _sensible_, and informed, color choice.\r\n- https://uxdesign.cc/githubs-dark-mode-is-too-dark-f6ab415cd4d4\r\n\r\n[1] Page 3, _Parameters_ `proposalMinQuorum`\r\n[2] Total supply of Ethereum Classic at Thu Apr  1 16:00:41 CDT 2021 estimated by https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-classic/ is __116,313,299 ETC__. \r\n- 1/3 of this would be 38,771,100 ETC (roughly $530,776,000 USD)\r\n- 1/300000000 would be 0.387711 ETC (roughly $5.31 USD)",
