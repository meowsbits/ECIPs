    "body": "As stated in more detail in the original ECIP-1049 proposal, I am against these moves to SHA3 or whatever varition of it. Please review the original ECIP-1049 for justification, as this proposal is more of an appendex to that far more detailed disucssion.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation will be to move ECIP-1049 (and this accompanied ECIP-1095) back to draft status as there are far too many unknowns related to the proposal.\r\n\r\nOutside of the unknown concerns. I also agree with @Dexaran's opinions above and do not think this move to ASIC is in the spirit of the Ethereum Classic network. This is a RADICAL change and DOES NOT improve the network security when looking at the proposals impact as a whole. Huge centralization risks on one of the most foundational elements of the network.",
