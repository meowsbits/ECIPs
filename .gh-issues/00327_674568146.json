    "body": "I could be misunderstanding the implementation so I apologize if that's the case. In case I'm wrong I'd appreciate if you explained to me why this would not be possible.\r\n\r\nLet's forget about 51% attacks and say the attacker wants to split the network. The `PenaltyCheckLength` variable is set to `60` for all clients.\r\n\r\nFrom [this line](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/go-callisto/blob/master/core/pirl_guard.go#L49) we can see that if I make a reorg of 60 blocks, the if condition will be false and hence we will have no penalty which means the reorg will happen and the person will switch to the attacker chain.\r\nSo the victim will now have last 60 blocks different from the mainnet. The attacker now also adds 1 more more block to the victim chain (could also add 10 or whatever). When the mainnet mines 2 blocks, the mainnet chain will have more PoW and the victim client will want to reorg, but since it will try to reorg 62 blocks, it will get a huge penalty due to the `int64(tipOfTheMainChain - incomingBlock)` computation in a [for loop for all reorged blocks](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/go-callisto/blob/master/core/pirl_guard.go#L50) that add to the penalty which means the victim chain will stay split for a long time.\r\n\r\nIf this is possible, then I could time these blocks in a way that roughly 1/3 or 1/2 of the network would receive them and become victims of a split. I could even make `K` splits if I made `K` different reorg chains and send them to different nodes.\r\n",
