    "body": "It seems a little convoluted,  but it will eventually resolve to the 'correct' chain if given malicious reorg.\r\n\r\n > \"Reasonable operating bounds for the victim of an eclipse attack to eventually recover and rejoin the network. \" \r\n\r\n31 x difficulty ceiling seems overly cautious, given the bounds of the difficulty adjustment algorithm and could cause longer than desirable delays before a node would reorg to a proper chain, but it does allow for eventual resolution.  \r\n\r\nSince this is an ecbp, the activation block could be genesis or any random block and, since this is only active on a synced chain, have the same effectiveness.  The coordination across nodes isnt as important since this allows a single node a ojective evaluation of incoming reorg blocks with eventual resolution even if it is 'wrong'. \r\n\r\nThis solution could work on a network with some nodes using the 'pirlguard'  proposal and makes the same assumption that as long as a majority of nodes are evaluating reorgs with the assumption they are unusual outside of some window (`n` blocks for pg or 200 sec for mess). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
