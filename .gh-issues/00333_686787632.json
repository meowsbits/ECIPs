    "body": "Thisis a copy and paste of a wish list from ALL the topics in the discord development channel. Your agenda was listed as \"To Be Determined\" with an ask to come here to recommend items. You're german so maybe its in your culture that you just take all of them and don't filter. But you just took that massive list for a 60 minute call. This tells me you're not qualified to run these meetings since anyone knows this is far too many topics for a 60 minute meeting.\r\n\r\nAdditionally you didn't even do the top bullet with was the most requested of anyone.\r\n\r\nLastly, you didn't even update the Agenda! it was still lsited as \"To Be Determined\" after the meetings when I came to recap! Your ability to never take blame for your actions is amazing. And You continue to rehash your failures to try to rewrite the past.\r\n\r\nLet's move on, we fixed your screw ups. there is no need to KEEP wasting valuable time on mudane process BS. You did this was sorpaas and you're doing it with MANY other like Charles and myself. Correct your behavior, you are PART of the problem not all of it.\r\n\r\nI should have been more clear on the message and stated \"This is an EXHAUSTIVE list from development channel. Please filter appropriate due to merit and time.\" That is my bad and i will do better next time.",
