    "body": "This is a copy and paste of a wish list from ALL the topics in the discord development channel. Your agenda was listed as \"To Be Determined\" with an ask to come here to recommend items. You're german so maybe its in your culture that you just take all of them and don't filter. But you just took that massive list for a 60 minute call. This tells me you're not qualified to run these meetings since anyone who has ran meetings knows this is far too many topics for a 60 minute meeting.\r\n\r\nAdditionally you didn't even do the top bullet which was the most requested of anyone.\r\n\r\nLastly, you didn't even update the Agenda. It was still listed as \"To Be Determined\" after the meetings when I came to recap! Your ability to never take blame for your actions is amazing. And you continue to rehash your failures to try to rewrite the past.\r\n\r\nLet's move on, we fixed your screw ups. There is no need to KEEP wasting valuable time on mudane process BS. You did this with sorpaas in all of 2019/2020 and you're doing it with MANY others like Charles, Dexaran, and myself. Correct your behavior, you are PART of the problem, not all of it.\r\n\r\nSo this doesn't look like it is just me commenting on this due to you rejecting my proposal in 21 days from drafting it because I wasn't at your vaguely scheduled meeting. You can search discord and find many complaints but this one was from the person documenting the calls for the recaps:\r\n\r\n\"Classic_Kevin_ECC08/20/2020\r\nI suggest people listen to Charles video re decision making. Every point in there is right on point. We’re skipping so many things that should give people time to discuss, provide feedback and ask questions and jumping straight to the philosophical side. Obviously not everyone understands all 4 of these proposals before we had a meeting that wasted time. Obviously not everyone knows if these proposals are even practical for this project if there’s already code written, if they are already in production or what. But we jump straight to the philosophical questions without fully understanding. Imo\"\r\n\r\nResults of your calls:\r\nSo now we have three ECIPs in `Last Call` status and no one has any idea about them so we are all scrambling to read about them. The people behind the proposals are scrambling to get the ECIP in order and wasting the purpose of the `Last Call` time. Example: ECIP-1043 is already changing its approach and ironing out details which is more in line with the `Last Call` purpose. ECIP-1049 and ECIP-1095 authors are not engaging the opposition to their proposals because they have no responses to the huge glaring holes in the proposals and are not technically competent to respond. For my proposal, I had to waste a night to bring back my ECIP from Rejected status to Draft status.\r\n\r\nOn me:\r\nI should have been more clear on the message and stated \"This is an EXHAUSTIVE list from development channel. Please filter appropirately due to merit and time.\" That is my bad and I will do better next time. I also should have left a public note that I would be out of service in the middle of the mountains, miles from civilization and not able to attend these vague \"Agenda: TBD\" calls you scheduled. I should have clearly pinged you. I left the notes in discord, but did not ping you. That is my bad. Also I will step up at times a take over hosting these meetings for topics i am vested in if I have to. I realize you're paid to do this by ETC Labs, but it is clear people are not satisfied with the service you're delivering in these calls to the network. Which is why teams are starting to hold thier own calls and removing you as a bottleneck to the process.\r\n\r\nThis will be my last message regarding the issue. It is done and over with, we are moving forward and have too much to do and too little time.",
