    "body": "I'm unsure if we should have the Veriblock ECIP on the table for this call as they have not presented their proposal, but plan to. I've been in contact with Max.\r\n\r\nHe says, _\"We are writing up a ETC-focused \"what is PoP and how will it protect ETC\" layman's explanation article which we want to publish prior to the call [presentation].\"_\r\n\r\nBased on the fact they haven't presented, although having much time to do so, I'm unsure if it would be fair to them to measure a consensus on moving their ECIP either way in the process. They plan on presenting their solution mid-next week as noted by Max here: https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/360#issuecomment-698594259\r\n\r\nTo be honest based on what I've seen I see the MESS solution as being the most effective out of the bunch. It also seems it would be much easier to implement into Besu given Chainsafe's affiliation in its creation. Mess seems much less complex and more in line with ETC's decentralized manifesto and declaration of independence, more than nearly all the others which either introduce layers of unnecessary complexity i.e. through new mining mechanisms, adding validators which will require some sort of on-chain governance mechanism (also we've maintaining a network with validators become a bit difficult on Kotti), or relying on a trusted third party whether it be another  network or validators.\r\n\r\nBy the way thanks for coordinating this call Afri! .",
