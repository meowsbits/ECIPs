    "body": "> Maybe there is a need for an overarching \"core principle / best practice\" : \"small reorgs are normal and healthy, large reorgs are suspicious.\r\n\r\nYes!\r\n\r\n> 31 x difficulty ceiling seems overly cautious\r\n\r\nUnderstood. I wanted to start with the \"most reasonably conservative\" value and work our way toward efficiency from there. My  reasoning being that an eclipse of one or a few (arguably ill-equipped) nodes is inconvenient but recoverable, but a too-low ceiling could be permanently bad for everybody. Do you have a counteroffer? 22x? 11x? 3x? Keep in mind, too, that the value may be quite safely modified later if desired.\r\n\r\n> The coordination across nodes isnt as important since this allows a single node a ojective evaluation of incoming reorg blocks with eventual resolution even if it is 'wrong'.\r\n> [...]\r\n> I think it should be fine if the solutions eventually resolve at different rates, as long as they resolve on the same chain.\r\n\r\nBut the nodes don't have an _objective_ evaluation, only (\"weakly\") subjective. \r\n\r\nTLDR: In short, I think, you want nodes to be suspicious of the same reorg at pretty close to the same time, because if they're not, they start getting suspicious of each other. \r\n\r\nIf nodes resolve at non-trivially different rates and if the unresolved chains share some portion of the mining power (honest or not), the time expected for the partitions to resolve back to a unified network starts diminishing, depending on the difference of the acceptance rate and the relative hashrate shares.\r\n\r\nDepending on the acceptance/rejection differences between clients, any variance has some opportunity for exploit by an adversary; and we have to expect that _some_ variance is a necessary characteristic of the subjective view. We can use Pirlguard's `20` \"shallow threshold\" as an extreme example, where an adversary may launch repeated serial or parallel propositions of 20 block segments. At one of these times of broadcast, presumably some portion of the network will be on block `n` and some on block `n-1`, and thus some (assume 50%) will allow one of these reorgs (`n-1`), while the others will not. This split continues depending on the hashrate split (again, have to assume 50%), and as it continues unification becomes less and less likely (and subsequent attacks go on 50% sale). This, in principle, is also the case with _any_ subjective acceptance arbitration, especially network-diverse implementations. The \"weak\" part of the ESS idea is to marginalize the normal, short reorg window so that it approaches a resemblance of objectivity. \r\n\r\n> the activation block could be genesis or any random block and, since this is only active on a synced chain, have the same effectiveness.\r\n\r\nAll observable discrete and non-unified arbitration points in subjective acceptance are technically exploitable. If the genesis or any historical block is the activation block, then if an attacker can differentiate nodes who have upgraded vs. those who haven't (say, by `clientId` version), and can launch a targeted attack when, say, 50% of the network is upgraded.\r\n\r\n",
