    "body": "> Well, Just few worlds. In Italy you pay 0,23â‚¬/kW. This Is the reasons why I had choosen RX 470 gpus (48w/26mh) @ Wall 8 x 470 + sys l+/- 500w x 200 mh. Eth Is going pos, 4 gb cards left with ravencoins. I understand all reasons above, but looking @ me this would be another chance.\r\n\r\nFor me this is rather a reason not to do this change. I mean consider having 8G instead of 4G cards. How would you think then?\r\nAlso consider this: if ETC profitability is halving, would you still mine it in Italy? Or if only 1/4 is left would you still stay? Likely: no. But others with only 10ct or lesser (some countries have only 3ct energy cost and less) would say yes - in lack of other options they would continue, because its still profitable there while its not here.\r\n\r\nSo what is going to happen: all the 4G miners with extra low energy cost will switch from eth to etc. Since eth network is so much larger this will dump the profitability and push out all miners from countries with higher energy cost ending up in a centralization of few huge mining operations with 4G farms in cheap power countries left. That might be happy - but loosing mining community of potential 8G miners everywhere else is worth it? I do not think so.",
