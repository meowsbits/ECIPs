    "body": "I wanted to raise another potential issue with the PirlGuard appraoch, and open up discusson on how the network would handle eclipse attacks.\r\n\r\nSome background on eclipse attacks here: \r\n\r\n- https://www.radixdlt.com/post/what-is-an-eclipse-attack/\r\n- https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-heilman.pdf\r\n- https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/236.pdf\r\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss6VmIxGrBk\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand, with PirlGuard, an eclipse attack (or an eclipse attack + 40% attack) would do extra damage to the network compared to not having PirlGuard in place. \r\n\r\nMy impression is that the subjective finality that is added with PirlGuard would, in the case of a long network partition (either by natural disasters or an eclipse attack), permenantly split or fragment the network (because of the reorg cap).\r\n\r\nThis type of attack wouldn't necessarily be about trying to profit from a double spend, but instead trying to create havok, perhaps in the hopes of manipulating the price of ETC with leveraged short positions, or simply for ideological reasons without a profit motive. For this reason I dont think that the chains that already use PirlGuard (with smaller market caps and less ideological beef) prove that this kind of attack isn't plausable, as the economics and politics are different.",
