    "body": "@SergioDemianLerner I have a question regarding your comment below.\r\n\r\n> The payments can also come from a treasury (i. .e ecip-1098). In that case the best implementation is having a federation (which can be either RSK's current federation or IOHK proposed federation) to issue the visibility proofs.\r\n\r\nHypothetically if there was some collaboration between the two, would there still be a required tax on mining rewards to pay for \"visibility proof miners?\" I recall you saying it is possible to use your solution without the need to give any portion of the miner's block rewards to visibility proof minersâ€”would that make this proposal non viable? Would the subsidy provided be temporary and what are the reciprocations of not providing any subsidy to them?\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I don't think taking away a portion of block rewards to subsidize third party miners in order to temporarily protect the network will sit well with the people in ETC, especially the ETC miners and given the many other solutions that don't involve such a mechanism and incentive to outside miners.",
