    "body": "> @gitr0n1n Are you joking? Have you seen the increased difficulty after switching Monero to RandomX?\r\n\r\nDoesn't an increased difficulty help secure the Ethereum Classic network? Currently Ethash is at a very low difficultly and we have experienced three 51% attacks in one month.\r\n\r\nMy opinon is that an ASIC-friendly option (SHA3) will result in less hashrate than Ethash (GPU) and more centralization. And, far less hashrate than CPU algos like RandomX.\r\n\r\nRisk: With more available hashrate comes the more opportunity for malicious rental hashrate market which is currently crippling the network under the Ethash algo. Would available CPU hash be as hostile as Ethash hash? I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nThis proposal was opened for public discussion to act as a compliment to the ECIP-1049 discussion which only discussed GPU (Ethash) and ASIC (SHA3) options. This puts a CPU option on the table.",
