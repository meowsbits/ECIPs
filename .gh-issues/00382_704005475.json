GPUs would still be able to mine SHA3/Keccak, as would FPGAs.\" - @developerkevin\r\n\r\n> Many of your talking points were discussed during the call. Please listen to the Ethereum Classic Core Developers Call 15 audio recording to learn about all the negative externalities of the ECIP-1049 proposal. Thanks!\r\nSource: https://vimeo.com/464336957",
