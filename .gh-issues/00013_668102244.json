    "body": "Thinking about this some more, the safest plan would be to roll this out along a long time frame. By that I mean: Accept the PR with at least a year (or even 2) timespan on getting triggered. I believe the recent attack has finally proven to most (even miners) that the current algorithm is not secure. However this is still going to be controversial to miners (for good reason, its not really fair!), however, if we roll this out far enough in the future it will allow them to recoup equipment costs to the point where current equipment would become useless for mining in 2 years anyway. \r\n\r\nThis will give us the best chance at getting nearly everyone on board IMO.\r\n\r\nA side benefit of this is that it also allows sufficient time for ASICs to be manufactured.",
