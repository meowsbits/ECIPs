    "body": "Isn't the core principle of this ECIP just protecting immutability of transactions?\r\n\r\nFour years ago the main threat to immutability that the ETC community saw was off-chain coordinated state intervention forks. Today we're living in a different world and the main threat is 51% attacks. MESS protects immutability by ensuring that after some period of time majority-hashpower-driven reversions are impossible.",
