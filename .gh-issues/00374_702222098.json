    "body": "I have a concern regarding the opt-in/opt-out property of MESS.\r\n\r\n_Assumption 1: Some of the nodes will follow MESS logic, some won't => some of the exchanges will follow MESS logic, some won't._\r\n\r\nSince the proposal allows people to choose, it means that there can be a temporary divergence of reality. The nodes that will be following MESS won't switch when a 51% attack happens and those that won't be following the MESS logic will reorg. We assume that the nodes will eventually converge to the same reality which will likely be the reality that MESS nodes see.\r\n\r\nIf the majority of miners don't follow MESS logic, then the attacker chain will survive. MESS only makes sense when the miners continue the chain they think is the honest chain.\r\n\r\n_Assumption 2: The majority of miners will be following MESS logic._\r\n\r\nNow let's assume we have a set of exchanges `S` that _don't_ follow the MESS logic. Let's observe what happens if an attacker creates a 5000 block reorg without a double spend and continues to mine for some time. Exchanges in `S` will reorg these blocks and be on the attacker chain. They all seem fine now, _but_ there is a big problem because if the assumption 2. is correct, then they will get reorged back after some time. This in turn means that users on every exchange could be doing double spending attacks in parallel without even knowing. When the MESS chain eventually overcomes the non-MESS and a reorg happens, then I suspect that every exchange in `S` can be double spent by their users.\r\n\r\nThis is possible because we are now allowing a temporary disagreement of reality. Nodes should at all times try to look at the same state otherwise we get a lot of weird \"sync problems\" that are hard to reason about. You could have \"opportunists\" checking which exchanges don't have MESS which are checking whether there's an ongoing 51% reorg and then do a double spend for free. Exchanges _MUST_ follow MESS if the miners follow it or they all open themselves to at least this attack.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that I missed something or that any of the assumptions I made are incorrect, but I do want to share a case I think is possible and very dangerous.",
