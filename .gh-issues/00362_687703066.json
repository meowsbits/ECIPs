    "body": "@q9f i'm reading the discussion in #general occurring right now. Since we are hold a 9/11 call. Should we prioritize the 51% solutions to get them moving through the process? I am having a hard time mentally justifying prioritizing ECIP-1049 (a one year plus roll out) over the 51% attack solutions that address the immediate threat to the network:\r\n\r\nSo high priority ECIPs:\r\nECIP-1043 https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/11\r\nECIP-1092 https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/327\r\nECIP-1097 https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/348\r\n\r\nOnce these three ECIPs are in motion we have ALL year to discuss moving the network to SHA3, as the network will then be out of the current fire.\r\n\r\nDo any of the current ECIP participants feel that the priority should be on these three 51% attack ECIPs right now and we shouldn't be rushing a miner algorithm change before addressing these solutions and stabilizing the network?\r\n\r\nMaybe my logic is flawed regarding this issue. Feel free to explain why.",
