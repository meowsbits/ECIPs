    "body": "> He is continuing his mis representation of multigeth as a legitimate source of truth for etc. it isnt.\r\n\r\nGood point on his efforts to represent his writing as legimate sources of truth for Ethereum Classic. \r\n\r\n> I want to make it abundantly clear that my code and actions have nothing to do with ETC any more. \r\n\r\nLooking into this right now and I am still seeing Sorpaas represent CorePaper as a legitimate source of truth for ETC as noted by his discord vanity:\r\nhttps://discord.io/ethereumclassic\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/B6frFC1\r\n\r\n\r\nBack story on this: I believe this vanity was created for CorePaper back when Sopaas amped up his misinformation campaign on Phoenix after ETC reached consensus. This was the link he frequently spammed leading up to the hard fork during his FUD/misinformation campaign. March/April/May 2020 in the ETC discord. This was also the time when he tried to discredit the ECIP process and form his own \"RFC process\".\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\"sorpaas03/14/2020\r\nAs I said before it's up to you whether you read it. We'll publish reviews in RFC process and Consensus Paper, and post links in Discord and Reddit. We can ping you directly if you don't follow those communication channels.\"\r\n\"sorpaas-don't-ping-only-PM!04/08/2020\r\nI would happy to invite anyone to join there! So far though all of the --oppose-phoenix-fork discussions have only happened in this Discord.\"\r\n\"sorpaas-don't-ping-only-PM!04/12/2020\r\nOkay guys if you want to find me, you know where! Matrix, Gitter, Telegram, Github or Core Paper discord https://discord.io/ethereumclassic\"\r\n\r\nThis was also around the time when he tried to manufacture an \"Anti-Phoenix\" faction being censored from the ETC discord and spammed the discord citing his own blog posts on CorePaper. Then waged a Twitter misinformation campaign against the mods for censorship in the ETC discord due to them removing his walls of repeative spam. Of course, in hindsight there was no anti-phoneix faction outside of himself.\r\n\r\n\"sorpaas-don't-ping-only-PM!03/09/2020\r\nSorry was just looking for evidence of censorship. Think I got what I need. Thank you!\r\nI don't think anything I sent here has issues - everything is ETC related, and it was to answer someone else's questions. In the long run, censorship will really just hurt this Discord -- blockchain protocols do not tolerate or care about lies. Bugs stay as bugs, unless you fix them.\r\nAnyway, if you're looking for thoughtful and censorship-free discussions, see you on the other side!\"\r\n\r\nThis was then followed by Sorpaas utilizing his permissioned roles in development repo's to add \"-oppose-phoenix\" flags in Multi-Geth and OpenEthereum to support the manufactured \"anti-phoenix\" faction.\r\n\r\n\"sorpaas-don't-ping-only-PM!04/15/2020\r\nWe have implemented --oppose-phoenix-fork support in OpenEthereum! A guide on choosing whether you want to support the contested Phoenix hard fork:\r\n\r\n* If you support Phoenix, use OpenEthereum, MultiGeth, CoreGeth or Besu, with your usual command line flag\r\n* If you do not support Phoenix, run OpenEthereum with --chain classic-oppose-phoenix-fork or run MultiGeth with --classic --oppose-phoenix-fork\r\n\r\nTo know more about the contention of Phoenix, you can read more about it here! https://consensus.corepaper.org/wiki/Contention_of_Phoenix_(new)\"\r\n\r\n\"sorpaas-don't-ping-only-PM!04/15/2020\r\nAs said, OpenEthereum and MultiGeth aims at remaining neutral. We received requests from other people that they want --oppose-phoenix-fork to be supported, so we do it. This is definitely not about whether me oppose the hard fork. As I have repeatedly said I remain neutral.\r\nThis is also why many of us agreed that we should flag this Phoenix hard fork as contested. In Ethereum Classic, users have the final say! :smiley:\"\r\n\r\nQuite the busy misinformation campaign when you look at the paper trail.",
