    "body": "Unlike [ECIP 1092](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/327) or [ECIP 1097](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/348) that actually propose to **SOLVE** 51% attacks this ECIP does not represent a solution.\r\n\r\nChanging the mining algo is not a solution at all. This does not solve the problem per se but instead is just delaying it in hope that things will go fine in a new environment while it is far from guaranteed.\r\n\r\n1. It is far from guaranteed that ETC will become the majority chain on a new mining algo. It is possible that there will be another \"newer and more overhyped project\" that will attract more miners and we will get exactly the same situation. But with new mining algo.\r\n\r\n2. \"The effect of Chandler Guo\" must be taken into account. There is a [historical evidence](http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/07/31/51pool-attack-plans-51-network-attack-ethereum-classic/) that some influential party may coordinate a 51%-attack for some (possibly political or even personal) reason. So did Chandler Guo and his 51pool at the very start of Ethereum CLassic project before we convinced him to join our ecosystem instead.  It is possible that some other party will do the same. Due to the lack of a technical solution at the protocol level, this would make ETC similarly vulnerable to 51% attacks.\r\n\r\n3. Since another solution at protocol level is still a necessity (as highlighted in previous two points) - changing mining algo is completely unnecessary and likely harmful for the ecosystem.",
