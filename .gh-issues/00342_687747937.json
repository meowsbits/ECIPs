    "body": "\r\n> We need to move beyond Ethash to be our own giant. Yes - there are concerns that miners have over the equipment they have invested in - 100% get that - but just because you have GPU rigs doesn't mean the overall future of the project should be limited to only use those.\r\n\r\nI get this, but why not take advantage of all that GPU hashpower that will soon(ish) no longer be mining ETH? \r\n\r\nIf the objection to retaining Ethash is that it is not secure enough, now or in the near future, to reduce the risk of a 51% attack to an acceptable level then that is a strong arguement for change. Is this the case though? If not and the argument for change is something other than attack prevention then I remain to be convinced. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
