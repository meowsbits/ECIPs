    "body": "The problem with SHA is, we should have started working towards an implementation last year. Now after the attacks, we kind of \"woke up\" and try to rush it. This change is probably the most involved that ETC will ever see and proposing a 9 months implementation timeline is the fastest possible.\r\n\r\nNow is September and no work on the clients has been started yet. 9 Months is June 2021. In that way, 1049 is not our 51% problem solver and therefore, 1099 provides a first step towards an own mining algorithm and 1100 are training wheels we can activate today until we do not need them anymore (i.e., on 1049 activation date).\r\n\r\nThat's my 51 cents.",
