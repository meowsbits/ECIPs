Consensus is a social process, and human beings are fairly good at engaging in consensus on our own without any help from algorithms...\"\r\n\r\nRepeat:\r\n\r\n\"Consensus is a social process...\"\r\n\r\n\"...human beings are fairly good at engaging in consensus...\"\r\n\r\n\"...without any help from algorithms...\"\r\n\r\nYeah! Brilliant! Hey, why don't we just use PayPal?",
