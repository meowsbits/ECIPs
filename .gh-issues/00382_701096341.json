    "body": "> I won't be able to attend the call on Friday, unfortunately, but I want to raise concerns that block 12 million activation is way too fast and should be carefully coordinated with the client developers.\r\n\r\nNoted, I'll vocalize this concern for you @q9f , same as i will vocalize a view other comments due to people not being able to attend the call.\r\n\r\nI hope we have people on the call that can vocalize for themselves. But I understand how some are not native English speakers and prefer to communicate via ECIP discussion threads. It's the goal to not penalize them for being unable to communicate via audio.",
