    "body": "@zmitton Without information about the specifics, I can't tell which FPGA they're using. Like CPUs, FPGAs come in different price/performance grades. The one I'm using is a low cost/low power small FPGA built on a slow 28nm process, and this project is meant as an open source illustration of pipelining and how a mining FPGA works generally. You wouldn't produce a commercial miner this way. Without specifics, I can't tell what FPGA they are using, but the cooling and power configuration give us a clue.\r\n\r\nA couple of factors make the difference. They probably have a large enough FPGA to do a fully pipelined 24 stage model which can generate 1 hash per clock. The FPGA I used doesn't have sufficient routing capability to accommodate 24 stages, so an 8 stage pipeline is used instead in 3 passes, yielding 1 hash per clock 1/3 of the time. Secondly, this cheap FPGA is limited to about a 75MHz clock for this design. This is a relatively low clock rate. Higher end FPGAs could run as high as 500MHz.\r\n\r\nThis \"$150 dollar FPGA\" is used merchandise, what was the original retail cost?",
