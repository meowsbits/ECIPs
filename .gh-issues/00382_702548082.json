    "body": "I'd also like to repeat another idea: most if not all of the conflict surrounding ECIP-1049 stems from it proposing the replacement of a key part of the ETC infrastructure, the PoW algorithm, in a way that is incompatible with the continued economic viability of current ETC mining hardware.\r\n\r\nA way to avoid forcing current ETC miners out of the ecosystem they have been supporting so far would be to start ECIP-1049 on a new coin (how about ETK ? K and C are often considered the same sound, and K would stand for Keccak.), and let ETC continue as before. The rules for ETK, including the allocation of initial assets, could be defined to the liking of its creators, and they could also define a schedule for launch and operation without any need to coordinate with the ETC community. ETC and ETK could (and should) still remain strong ties, e.g., EVM compatibility, and if ETK turns our to be superior, people could switch from ETC to it on their own volition, without the trauma of a forced migration.\r\n\r\nAdopting this approach would remove the ECIP-1049 controversy from ETC and ETK, and make room for issues that should perhaps be more important for the future of ETC/ETK, e.g., the development of attributes that will make people want to choose ETC/ETK over, say, ETH, or other coins.",
