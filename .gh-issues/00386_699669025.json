    "body": "Wholeheartedly agree with all of this. A reasonable proto-treasury, keccak-256 algorithm dominance, and MESS protocol will absolutely turbocharge the ETC chain. This roadmap is good to go and should be implemented. \r\n\r\nECIP-1049 has been updated to be in line with the spirit and urgency of the Protocol Compact:\r\n\r\nActivation Block: 12,000,000 (approx. 4 months from acceptance - January 2021)\r\nFallback Activation Block: 12,500,000 (approx. 7 months from acceptance - April 2021)\r\nIf not activated by Block 12,500,000, ECIP-1049 is voided and moved to Rejected.",
