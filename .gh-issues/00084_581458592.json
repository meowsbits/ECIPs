    "body": "@meowsbits Also bear in mind that we now have Whiteblock Genesis at our disposal for exactly this kind of cross-client ETC testing need.   It would be great if we could make use of that capability for ETC Aztlan/Phoenix testing:\r\n\r\nhttps://genesis.whiteblock.io/\r\n\r\n@YazzyYaz has been giving it a whirl.   We are also proposing Yaz as a Vice-Chair for the EEA Testing WG with @atoulme and @zscole at the helm.\r\n\r\nETC Cooperative can also take on running instances of ethereum/tests, HIVE, ChainSafe amenome, whatever.   I want us to have the same degree of coverage as there is for ETH.   Union of \"all the things\", including ethstats and forkmon instances.\r\n\r\nCC @GregTheGreek, @edwardmack.",
