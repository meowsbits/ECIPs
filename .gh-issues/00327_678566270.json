    "body": ">Additionally the #general channel has been flooded with new accounts shilling of your proposal for nearly two weeks. You've had community members engaging in thoughtful discussion related to the technical merits of the proposal.\r\n\r\nI'm an active contributor of large projects like Ethereum and EOS so there are some people interested in what I'm doing. Also, the proposed protocol has some followers already because it is not my invention and it is not the first time the protocol is being used to solve a problem of 51%-attacks.\r\n\r\n>Fair enough, you're right about the Q&A between teams. It was one of my suggestions after the backlash from the call for those that desired talking during that call but didn't get the opportunity.\r\n\r\nI will try to have a representative for the next call. I agree that having a video/audio explanation and a number of representatives is better than just a pure text description.\r\n\r\n>In any case, I drafted up this little blog to try to keep track of all the evolving proposals and topics buzzing around the ECIP world\r\n\r\nGreat work, thank you.",
