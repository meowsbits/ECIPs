    "body": "> So going SHA3 and adding SHA3 recompile would let ETC do on chain verification of ETH headers but not visa versa.\r\n\r\nwell, ETH headers are currently ethash, which is keccak512-based. so adding SHA3 won't help there. ETH2 is currently specced to use SHA2, which ETC already supports, but additionally would require support for BLS12-381 signature verification\r\n\r\n> Much like BTC limitations hindering anything bidirectional between BTC and ETC?\r\n\r\nyeah, although usually unidirectional communication + bonding is sufficient. See the TBTC design\r\n\r\n> Feeling on likelihood of SHA3 precompile for ETH happening?\r\n\r\nSomeday :tm:. I wouldn't count on it any time soon",
