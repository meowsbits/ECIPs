    "body": "> If it is not necessary, changing the algorithm only causes mistrust. In this situation when there is a possibility that some part of the 100 TH/s (4 GB cards that mine ETH, which due to the size of the DAG file will not be able to do it from December 2020) switch to ETC, changing the algorithm to me personally looks like sabotaging ETC. Why has Bitcoin never changed its algorithm and thus piss on its miners? There are even other solutions (in addition to increasing hashrate) to solve 51% attacks (Pirlguard, checkpointing,...).\r\n> If ETC goes Asic friendly, I am not interested anymore. I am a small GPU miner with no intention to buy Asic, I think most of the network will agree me. I love decentralization, Asic is against that.\r\n\r\nI was banned from discord for opposing SHA3, according to the developers in the general channel you can talk about SHA3, but if you are a GPU miner and you oppose SHA3 you can only express it in the mining channel, the change to SHA3 has a clear interest economic of a few leaving aside the interests of 5700 miners who currently support the ETC network, as a form of rejection of SHA3 a few miners withdrew our \"filthy\" hashrate from the ETC network and took it to eth.crazypool. org, everyone who is against the change to SHA3 is welcome at eth.crazypool.org",
