    "body": "The idea of a treasury system sounds very appealing, tempting even for others. Once Charles from IOHK joined the conversation the hopes of everyone rose sky high and I welcome that warmly. The drive in his speech is motivating and what he says about innovating and diversification is key towards the way out of this blind alley. Unfortunately that's where the euphoria ends, because the treasury system goes against all principles where open source community stands for. Money solves the solution in your head, projected into the future. Once reality kicks in you will see that money will create more problems than it solves. People who don't have any money will say I'm wrong, they who have money will understand what I'm talking about.\r\nAnyways then there's the price and content. As of now I haven't heard a price for the product, implementation, nor for continuous support. Remember that Charles mentioned at least ten times he spent 1.5 million on the solution, he also left this decentralized project to start a governed centralized project of its own and that spirit is rooted in all of his proposals. There's no denying that he likes money and control.\r\nThe fact there's a miners reward is that they have to invest (meaning risking a return in the future) in physical hardware and pay the bills to keep it running. Yes, developers also need a computer and that also needs juice but doesn't come near the amount invested by miners. I'm not saying here that developers must work for free and they cannot accept any money for the important and sometimes brilliant work they deliver. But saying we try a funding campaign and it didn't work is like saying I tried to wash the car but my arm isn't long enough to get around, try harder! Get creative, just like the innovation that is needed to boost the possibilities for the $etc road map. You will see once tipping becomes effortless and you create value there will be individuals or even groups that will fund your project. Only disbelief can block that reality and if you deliver decent work than the reward will be greater that the meager fund you would've received from the treasury system but therefore you have to earn it.\r\nThere's also the need for creating a community with more respect towards each other, encouragement, creating a vision and designing a clear path towards that goal without losing the principles that makes the heart of Ethereum Classic pump.\r\nLet the Phoenix spread its wings and rise from the ashes! <3",
