    "body": "From @sorpaas on OpenEthereum Discord:\r\n\r\n*By the way I’m considering clarifying this in EIP-2200 — https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2514 That will mean reverting #11474. That won’t affect Ethereum at all so shouldn’t be a big deal.*\r\n\r\nSo my read on this (and please do confirm, Wei), is that EIP-2200 reused a variable in a way which worked \"by mistake\" for ETH, but caused the confusion which is at the root of the consensus split on Mordor and Kotti.   Though that consensus split is only **currently** manifesting for Hyperledger Besu clients.\r\n\r\nIf the confusion was all just caused by the reused variable in EIP-2200 then the resolution is simple - making Hyperledger Besu match the Parity-Ethereum and Geth/Multi-Geth behaviours and doing a release.   The patches to Parity-Ethereum, Geth and Multi-Geth would be reverted, your errata to EIP-2200 merged, and matching code changes to clarify made to each of the clients (though these could not affect consensus - just clarity of implementation of the specification).\r\n\r\n@soc1c @GregTheGreek @meowsbits ^^\r\n",
