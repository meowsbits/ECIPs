    "body": "@phyro your questions are valid and ur understanding is on the right path.\r\nbut keeping a small PenaltyCheckLenght(10) and keeping a healthy set  honest and synced nodes will make any attack really hard as the codebase already handles small reorgs witch leads to a very small window. As I said many times (and at some point I started expanding on the code but didn't have the time to complete it) **this is NOT a complete 51% attack prevention**. \r\n**On the other hand pirlguard has secured many chains and mitigated a good amount of attacks.** It would be trivial to test (even ur edge case) and implement even expand to suit ur needs.\r\nAs right now the ETC chain is getting attacked at a regular basis why not try the solution on a test net where you can also evaluate all the assumptions that you might have regarding limiting and splitting and proper parameters.\r\nHope that helps ",
