Developing the sophistication of transaction capacities seems meaningful in this context. And [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718), via [ECIP-1103](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1103), proposes a tidy, generic way for us to do just this.\r\n- Transactions are unilaterally agnostic about chain state; they depend on and modify chain state intrinsically (_a posteriori_), but have no way of describing any dependencies on chain state as parameters for their validity (_a priori_). (Indeed, _contracts_ have access to certain state values, but their use demands gas and on-chain, permanent logic). \r\n  To offer an example, we might consider a transaction interacting with a DeFi contract. The transaction author saw a whale buy an asset at price X in the latest block N. The transaction author subsequently wants to get in on the action and buys at X+1, which gets mined at block N+1. Two blocks are reorged and the whale's transaction has been replaced with a buy at a lower price Z (or omitted entirely), but our victim's buy still stands at X+1. With a restrictive chain context on `ancestorId`, our author can specify that her transaction is only valid if the original block remains canonical. The proposed `expiry` field fits in here obviously, too.\r\n- Currently, miners are almost entirely homogeneous from the perspective of a transaction author; there is no capacity to identify or articulate preference. Want a transaction Made in the USA :registered:? At this point, this effectively requires sending your preferred miner an email (and hoping they don't turn around and sell it). In other words, chain provenance is a black box for transaction authors. \r\n- Miner omniscience and unchecked arbitration coupled with transaction passivity enable potentially malicious MEV (Miner Extracted Value) schemes. The capacity for transaction authors to spurn a miner (or reward an honest one) is a potentially significant tool in leveling this playing field.\r\n\r\nIt's been a long day, and I'm pooped, so I'm going to leave this at that for starters. \r\nI hope you have questions, and look forward to tackling them together.\r\n\r\n",
