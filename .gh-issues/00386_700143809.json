    "body": "@q9f \r\n\r\n> What's the purpose of this document? And how do we benefit from this bundle?\r\n\r\nNoticing there is considerable support for changes I don't agree with (treasury & MESS), and delays or less support for a change I agree with (Keccak256), but at the same time ETC needs a fast solution ASAP as it is losing and is under the threat of losing further liquidity, a key component of its security model, the purpose of this ECIP-1101 is to offer the acceptance of treasury and MESS with time limits (5 years) in exchange for the permanent implementation of Keccak256. It also seeks to make these decisions as soon as possible, without undermining the ECIP process in general.\r\n\r\n> What role does EIP-1099 play?\r\n\r\nECIP-1101 implicitly discards 1099. The rationale is for ETC to move directly to SHA3 as it is a proven function, clean and easy to build hardware for, and relatively unique in the blockchain industry. It is my view that it is waste of time to continue trying to fix ETHash/ETChash.\r\n\r\n> ...why do you believe - out of all proposals - that we need on-chain governance to make Ethereum Classic progress in future? We have proven that Classic is alive by planning and executing 3 protocol upgrades in the last 12 months and we are about to finalize the 4th. How would locking ETC and voting on chain help with progress? I personally believe this is just distraction. Also, do we know who the main ETC holders are that would rule the chain in future?\r\n\r\nI agree with you. I don't agree with the treasury, if that is what you are referring to by \"on-chain governance\". I think others like the treasury because it removes central power from ETC Labs, who are the only ones who have and are investing money in the system.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nIn summary I don't like the treasury nor MESS, but would like to see sha3 implemented ASAP and MESS and the treasury limited in time, so ETC eventually falls back to its original design.\r\n\r\nIf the above does not happen then I will oppose both MESS, the Treasury, and ECIP-1099.\r\n",
