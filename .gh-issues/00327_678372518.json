    "body": "For what its worth @Dexaran, I prefer this method over the `algorithm change` methods as I believe the risks of those changes are far greater than remaining on Ethash and finding a solution. Additionally, from what I've seen on the Checkingpointing and Timestamping system of IOHK, I'm not a fan of the idea of relying on a separate `federated chain` to secure ETC. So this proposal appears to be the most logical solution I've read thus far. That's not to negate the fair criticism listed in above comments. Just my opinion on the matter.",
