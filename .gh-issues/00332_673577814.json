(missing some details here)\r\n- vitalik never posted on the cardano subreddit until the treasury debate\r\n\r\nq&a:\r\n- isaac asks about design specifics\r\n\t- charles consideres ballots and different voting mechanisms\r\n- chris: you mentioned that a supermajority of etc would be able to shut it off. do we even know that 70%+ of etc is still active? also, how will you ensure that the 'simple' phase one moves to phase 2, as there is a disincentive for 3 core teams to do this. \r\n  - charles answers this one (missed some bits)\r\n- who are the 3-4 teams that will be funded and how are they decided?\r\n  - charles: the people maintaining core clients: there are three - mantis, ...\r\n- (missed)\r\n- this is likely going to be a contentious fork. why should miners support the treasury chain instead of keeping the existing chain alive in which they are not taxed?\r\n  - charles: this chain has a long track record without many activity; users are incentivized to move to the new chain\r\n- alex: what about an opt-out flag to burn treasury rewards\r\n  - charles: interesting, this is giving a vote to the miner, we can add this to the ecip\r\n- (missed)\r\n- afri proposes slido q&a event code #etctreas to priotize questions: https://app.sli.do/event/fxvuq4xl\r\n- charles: mantis will be ready by november (???)\r\n- charles: will write ecip\r\n- terry: can charles give an honest assessment of why the treasury proposal was rejected last time it was proposed?\r\n  - charles: people wanted to run the experiment decentralized funding, same as bitcoin\r\n  - charles: \"are you happy? or do you want a change, i'm proposing a change?\"\r\n- how is etc treasury proposal different than decred's current treasury system? it sounds very similar.\r\n  - charles: try something different\r\n- how does adding another client (mantis) solve any of our current issues, does it not introduce issues like we just faced with the chainsplit?\r\n  - solving 51% is pretty straight forward, checkpointing!\r\n  - innovate on the proof-of-work side (?)\r\n  - don't develop a monoculture\r\n- voting would be weighted by your stake, correct? we have some accounts that have a lot of etc and could hence themselves be the supermajority, no?\r\n  - yes, could do stake-weighted voting\r\n  - beacuse it's pow, it could include a voice of the miners\r\n  - also could do reputation metrics\r\n  - charles is not in favor of plutacratic systems\r\n\r\necip discussion:\r\n- yaz asked who is pro treasury, any opinion?\r\n- alex thinks it's a great idea now\r\n- ecc & etc core have contributed to the etc network for the past several years with real fund, while iohk left for a long time. why should iohk get fund (3m) from miners, not others? why should we trust iohk? ... (interrupted)\r\n- charles: we have been here from the beginning\r\n- terry: let him finish the question\r\n- yaz: (continues) ...  can charles contribute to etc network with his personal assets for 1-2 years starting right now?\r\n- charles: we have spent millions and brand in etc... is this even a legitimate question?\r\n- charles: we need to innovate, this is our only option available to us\r\n- alex: etc labs is rude and opaque in funding\r\n- terry: why would we take away from the miners?\r\n- charles: well, everyone is taxed. we tried no-funding approach for all the years. it didn't work. we don't have unlimited time.\r\n- yaz: 6 minute over time\r\n- yaz: why should we trust etc labs?\r\n- terry: it's not about trust, we are going to contribute to etc regardless.\r\n- zane: what should we look at for an accurate take on what this treasury proposal is? you mentioned that the 2017 white paper is stale. if so what's changed?\r\n- charles: we'll write an ecip. hopes that on-chain changes will be mild. the actual complexity lives in a solidity smart contract.\r\n\r\nyaz closes the call.\r\n- yaz: next week we'll have a call about how to mitigate 51% attacks\r\n- bob: wanted to express support, for the simple reason that growing etc is the root solution for a lot of problems\r\n- alex: (missed)\r\n- stev: (missed)\r\n- hudson: has the zcash style major grants committee structure been explored at all by those proposing the treasury?\r\n- charles: (sorry charles, you use so many words to describe these things)\r\n(i'm stopping to write protocol after 82 minutes)\r\n\r\nappendix - unanswered chat questions:\r\n- so you see the future of etc as pow/pos hybrid, similar to decred? (no answer)\r\n- who will own the pkeys of the smart contract?? how will a etclabs github take over be prevented??? (no answer)\r\n- what about funding for the developer outside of those 3-4 teams? (no answer)\r\n- when will etc network be safe so that exchanges can accept transactions? right now etc is under attack by everyone and there is a chance that exchanges will delist etc! we need to act very fast. (no answer)\r\n- doesn't charles have a conflict of interest? - he is a cardano founder, iohk ceo, but yet he is helping another project that most would consider a competitor to cardano? (no answer)\r\n- dapps devs getting funded was mentioned. however the treasury onlyu funds 3 entities. how are dapp devs assumed to receive funds?\r\nwould iohk accept a different treasury proposal - where three/four teams are not funded off the bat but instead a fund is built and paid to teams based on projects/proposals\r\n- why is my question not asked? (no answer)\r\n- how can we hold treasury system participants accountable if they miss deadlines or do not produce results beneficial to chain security? (no answer)\r\n- how does adding another client (mantis) solve any of our current issues, does it not introduce issues like we just faced with the chainsplit? (no answer)\r\n- thoughts on rebranding the etc name to something different?  especially all the negative press, and the changes that will happen to etc. (no answer)\r\n- what is the purpose of a treasury? also, heck i'm in time out? what? (no answer)\r\n- if i release some software tonight, that makes running nodes with existing functional clients, easier (~2 clicks for a core-geth node). can i replace iohk in the intial treasury, until they deliver a working mantis client? (no answer)\r\n- what happens if the dev reward is too large due to etc price appreciation? (no answer)\r\n- how to solve the conflict of interests of ada & etc? can charles step down at cardano and focus on etc? (no answer)\r\n- why cant a treasury be done layer2 like the #communityfund, we have funding in the ecosystem, even myself would donate to a treasury on layer2 if i knew it was actually going to be used instead of sit there (no answer)\r\n- what about the other dev teams that left? are they guarenteed x/x if they return and make clients? (no answer)\r\n- no ones explained how the funding reaches dapp devs. can anyone elaborate on this? (no answer)\r\n- if igor returns with etcdev and emerald - should he get funding? (no answer)\r\n- what if etc price goes to the moon, do you need that much money? (no answer)\r\n- what affect did the 51% have on the price? what effect would a treasury have on the price? (no answer)\r\n\r\nmore questions: https://app.sli.do/event/fxvuq4xl/live/questions",
