    "body": "For the papertrail, some discussion from ETC Discord ...\r\n\r\nBob: ECIP-1086 makes a lot of sense to me and has my support.\r\n\r\nsoc1c: besu and geth already have PRs\r\nnot sure who would implement this in Parity\r\n\r\nBob: @soc1c So that would likely have to be ChainSafe.  I am happy for ETC Cooperative to pay for that work, if there is engineering capacity available for that, @GregTheGreek?\r\n\r\nGregTheGreek: @bobsummerwill We can definitely do it\r\n\r\nDonald: seems the name should be changed to \"ChainSave\" \r\n\r\nCody: We control the validators on kotti seems straight forward. There shouldn't be any expectations that testnets wont be reset periodically.\r\nI agree ecip1086 solves the problem, but it is a testnet problem. We found a problem with an implementation and know how to fix it. We can just pick a block number and redo\r\nResetting the testnet sets expectations\r\n\r\nBob: And that is the plan, right, @DontPanicBurns?\r\nAnd ECIP-1086 just the specification of that plan to coordinate that switchover between the different clients.\r\nWe can argue that there is no need for the ECIP - that we can just agree to make those changes and switch over - just by the clients making that change themselves - but the specification gives us the papertrail and coordination.\r\nI don't see any downside to pushing that ECIP through the process as well as doing the work within the clients.\r\nWe do include testnet activation blocks within the ECIP process too, which you could argue does not need that same degree of coordination.\r\nBut we have all the same coordination problems with the shared, public testnets as we do with the mainnet.   Just not the same economic impact.\r\n\r\nCody:  That is not the plan as proposed in 1086\r\nWe are doing a testnet only fork. This will not be the same fork that will happen on mainnet\r\n\r\nBob: Right.\r\n\r\nCody: It needs to be a clean test that mirrors exactly what will happen on mainnet when aztlan happens\r\nWe are not doing a one two punch on mainnet, we should not do a one two punch on testnet\r\n\r\nBob: So that test is not possible on Mordor and Kotti anymore.\r\nECIP-1086 is about getting those back in consensus so they can be used.\r\n\r\nTo do what you are suggesting would need additional new testnets to be created.\r\nAs happened with Nazgul for Atlantis.\r\n\r\nCody: Why is it not possible\r\n\r\nBob: And maybe that should happen too, yes.\r\n\"Why is it not possible\"\r\n\r\nNot possible without resetting which might screw end-users up in a way which we cannot quantify.\r\n\r\nCody:  It is a testnet\r\nWe are the enduser\r\n\r\nBob: But \"we\" (ie. the group talking here) are not all the users of Kotti.\r\n\r\nCody:  Expectation set\r\nEverything on the testnet can be trivially resubmitted\r\nIf it isnt trivial, it should be running on mainnet for a fee\r\nWe dont know what happens when all the eips/ecips are activated at the same time\r\n\r\nBob: You are describing a desirable world, but that world is not the world we are currently living in.   We do not and cannot know the consequences onto end users of resetting the testnets.\r\n\r\nThere was no clear expectation set that testnets may be reset at will.\r\n\r\n\"We dont know what happens when all the eips/ecips are activated at the same time\"\r\n\r\nSounds like we need some more (temporary) testnets as well as Kotti and Mordor.\r\n\r\nCody: No we need to reset the screed up fork in the yestnet\r\nOr throw the other two in the garbage\r\n\r\nBob: Which would do the atomic Aztlan+Phoenix activation at the same block.\r\nWe can dry run that transition multiple times on those testnets.\r\n\r\nSame as for the Keccak256 tests.   That Ethash to Keccak256 transition is something which you want to dry-run (for all of the stack including clients, mining software, exchanges, wallets) multiple times.\r\n\r\nCody: Kotti is that testnet that should be restarted frequently.\r\n\r\nBob: Maybe.\r\n\r\nBut that is a change of expectations which would need to be worked through the ECIP process itself, build human consensus, etc.\r\n\r\nCody: Or make an un fork block\r\nO done see any change\r\nIs there an ecip creating the kotti network?\r\nOr anything stating a general view of \"why testnets exist\"\r\n4 people need to update their nodes to change anything on kotti\r\nOr maybe 5 I forget how many validator we have\r\nIts equally a pain in my ass to update my node to reset the testnet as it is to update my node to do forks\r\n\r\nBob: \"Is there an ecip creating the kotti network?  Or anything stating a general view of \"why testnets exist\"\r\n\r\nThere should be.\r\nBecause at some point it became an implicit assumption that any ETC mainnet consensus change should first make its way through the ETC testnets.   First, I guess, only assuming Classic Morden, at some point adding Kotti to the mix, and then with Agharta including Mordor instead of Classic Morden.\r\n\r\nThere was an ECIP for defining Clique, but the creation of Gorli and Kotti happened outside of the ECIP process.   @soc1c would be more aware of that history than me.\r\nECIP-1000 and eventually ECIP-0001 should probably define our expectations about testnets, and our specific expectations for Mordor and Kotti during the phase where we are \"dry-running\" hardforks.\r\n\r\nEven if we have not explicitly specified it as a requirement, I think it exceedingly unlikely that any HF would be Accepted if it did not include activation blocks for both Mordor and Kotti, with the expectation that the ECIPs included in that HF would be tested on both testnets prior to mainnet activation.\r\n@GregTheGreek @isaac @soc1c Would be exceedingly useful for you guys to speak up at this stage, either here on the Discord or better yet on the Github issues and PRs.\r\nOr better yet, @DontPanicBurns, for you and me to take this discussion  there too.\r\n\r\nGreg:  Theres honestly too much noise at this point\r\nits becoming increasignly difficult to monitor and help this channel\r\nI believe i approved @soc1c pr, it logically makes sense\r\nTo respond to @DontPanicBurns i completely disagree with you. Rolling back a testnet is not the right way to go about things. Patching all the way. Treat your testnets like its your mainnet.\r\nHF dev is the same as traditional software dev. Your stages:\r\nDev -> Staging -> Prod\r\n\r\nIn blockchain world how isee it:\r\nLocal or personal networks -> Testnets -> Mainnet\r\nTraditionally speaking, if you broke staging and had to revert, its a failure.\r\n\r\nHusain: only 4 different people other than you (Bob/Tala/Cody/Donald ) have been contributing since the 6th of Feb...\r\nand only in the last few days has this been active with Donald/Bob discussing ECIP0001 and now the testnet roll back issue\r\nhow on earth is it becoming increasingly difficult to monitor this channel?\r\n\r\nCody:  Traditionally speaking, if you broke staging and had to revert, its a failure.\r\n\r\nStaging was broke it revealed the error, we need to revert\r\nI approved the ecip because it is proper ally formated\r\n",
