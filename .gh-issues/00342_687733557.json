    "body": "1. The objection argument \"the centralization by one ASIC manufacturer\":\r\nIf there will be a demand for such devices, other companies will start to manufacture these, too. It is how a market work. Supply and demand. As it is easy to produce, based on the argument of the championer, the prices would also be relatively affordable.\r\n\r\n2. \"The IoT-goal of this project\":\r\nThe aim of this project is to be IoT suitable. For it should have the highest avaible security standard. The security standard of the Ethash is not enough based on the recent news provided by the championer. This means, that this project would remain as a hobby project and people invested in this project with their time and money will be down the drain. \r\n\r\n3. The objection \"it does not protect against the relatively large reorganizations in the network\":\r\nNobody said, that **it will**. What was said, is, that it will give a chance to be a major blockchain with this algorithm. This project is popular. Higher the algo standard, more attractive it will get, more (serious) people would be interested to do on/with this project, value would go higher, more miners would join, more secure the network would be, fewer the chance the network would have relatively large reorganizations.
