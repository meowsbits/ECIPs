    "body": "- Parity. In order for this proposal to match the [Berlin Network Upgrade Specification](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/berlin.md) it (now) needs to [remove EIP-2315](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22414). \r\n\r\n- Timelines. I assume that the block numbers in the spec are intended tentatively. Ethereum is aiming for an ETH mainnet activation at `12_244_000` (14 Apr 2021), and this spec proposes \"May 2021\" for ETC mainnet activation. For the sake of conservative risk management I propose targeting a minimum of 45-60 days behind the intended ETH activation. ",
