    "body": "> I will answer all questions that are presented to me on the call, but I am too busy to answer everything posted in the comments. My apologies.\r\n\r\n`Last Call` - An ECIP that is done with its initial iteration and ready for review by a wider audience.\r\n`Accepted` - An ECIP that has been in Last Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author.\r\n\r\nShould we be eating up time on a CDC so you can hold a Q&A on your ECIP-1049 proposal that has so many comments you don't have time to answer them?\r\n\r\nLet's think of a productive approach to this:\r\n\r\nCan you host your own Q&A outside of the CDC process like other development teams are doing (1097 and 1092)? This is a win/win because it does not drain the limited CDC resources to your proposal and let's ECIP participants focus on the immediate 51% attack solutions that could improve the network right now. And it allows you to host a ECIP-1049 specific Q&A meeting on 9/11.\r\n\r\nThat feels like a nice accommodation. Format thought: You could read through every comment that is unanswered, Record the response to them on 9/11 for the public to consume and digest. Then your proposal can continue to be reviewed on the October 2nd date that was set on 8/28.\r\n\r\nThat seems like a fair compromise to the process and the proponents of ECIP-1049. Your proposal would not help the network for at least a year if I am reading correctly. So that is why I am suggesting we prioritize the 51% attack solutions that help in the immediate over long term approaches to network stability like ECIP-1049. @antsankov \r\n\r\nSo:\r\nECIP-1043\r\nECIP-1092\r\nECIP-1097",
