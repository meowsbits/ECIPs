    "body": "Once ECIP-1049 activates, ETC will be the most profitable coin for 3 GB hardware. Once ETH's DAG goes over 4 GB (i.e., in December), ETC will be the most profitable coin for 4 GB hardware, too. If ETC is the most profitable coin for them, this is a strong incentive for miners to be loyal.\r\n\r\nAlso, you don't need to be a majority chain to be safe from 51% attacks - it's sufficient to have enough honest hash rate to match the hash rate the attacker controls plus any vacant hash rate they can pick up. Thus, even the relatively small changes we can expect ECIP-1049 to produce will greatly raise the barrier for attackers.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, while the software change is small, it is significant enough to prevent current hash rate rentals from being able to redirect \"generic\" Ethash rate across coins. Even if they were to implement a way to propagate this parameter to their miners (which would involve changing the mining software and also their pool protocol - a departure from the current low barrier of access), the difference would still be visible to them, so they could easily implement checks on their end. We already have practical evidence that hash rate brokers are interested in proactively preventing their services from being be abused, so we'll all be working towards the same goal here.",
