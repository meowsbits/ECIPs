    "body": "The VisibilityProof proposal establishes an objective cryptoeconomic method to establish the existence of a fork. In the draft proposal we left out how the community or the node wants to react to a visible fork. I think this could be another proposal.\r\nOne way to react is use PirlGuard to apply penalties to forks with no public visibility (not VisibilityProofs) of a certain time gap, or with visibility proofs with low hashrate.\r\nYou can measure visibility in absolute terms or in relative terms. For example, you can establish that a blockchain fork that has 50% of the visibility hashrate of another branch is condireder hidden for PirlGuard. Or you can consider that a blockchain fork that has less than 33% of Bitcoin hashrate or has a visibility gap of 3 hours or more, is considered hidden.        ",
