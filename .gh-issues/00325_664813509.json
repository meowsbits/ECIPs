    "body": "I want to make it abundantly clear that my code and actions have nothing to do with ETC any more. I have announced deprecation of ETC already back in June. https://that.world/~classic/2020/06/10/deprecate/\r\n\r\nIn addition to ETC's loss of immutability, that was also a legitimate and necessary response to the continued toxicity from the ETC community, like the toxicity you see at @realcodywburns's comments.\r\n\r\nClients I have involved in, MultiGeth and OpenEthereum, have also both announced deprecation of ETC support. At the time of deprecation, they makes up of ~70% ETC total node count. https://twitter.com/sorpaas/status/1283953287495135232\r\n\r\nI also want to make it abundantly clear that anyone who [tries to claim](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/325#issuecomment-664695474) that any of my action still has anything to do with ETC is either trying to scam you, or doing a misinformation campaign. If that happens, just ask the person for first-hand direct-quote proofs, which he/she won't be able to provide any.",
