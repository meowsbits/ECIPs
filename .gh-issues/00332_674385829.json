    "body": "First of all, I am in favor of Treasury, but I don't agree with this preliminary draft( put forwards byt charles )\r\n\r\n1.Treasury is used to fund future teams. Don't tell ETC what you did in the past or when you started to support ETC, it is not the reason why you should get funding. \r\n\r\n2.Treasury should not provide equal funding for several specific teams. Each team has different contributions, there are also high and low levels of competence among developers, why should Treasury divide the funding equally? That doesn't make sense. Team A works really hard, and team B just writes A few docs and copies A few lines of code, why do they have the same fund?\r\n\r\n3.It's ok to build Treasury with smart contracts, but don't expect it to be able to evaluate the contributions of different teams.\r\n\r\n \"Talk is cheap, show me the code\".\r\n\r\n4.Why are these teams getting funding? Who are these teams (A legitimate enterprise or an unregistered organization)? How can we trust their financial disclosure? How many developers do they have? Do they have a public resume? Why can't funding support individual developers or non-development teams? Why doesn't the fund go directly to commercial enterprises to pay for development?\r\n\r\n5.Charles used tax to compare Treasury, thinking that it was miners' expense for security. I think it's ridiculous. The Internet promises safety first,  then miners participate in it, if it is a tax for security, the Treasury should tax exchanges and users, not miner.\r\n\r\n6.If Treasury is designed to motivate developers, are non-developers in ETC lab or etc-cope eligible for funding? For example, secretaries, clerks, accountants, bloggers. If they are eligible for funding, and the ETC community has a large number of individual contributors, why can't they get funding?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I believe that to achieve a fair Treasury system, there must be committees and voting rights, and mining pools and exchanges should be involved to prevent fraud in the name of development.\r\n\r\nDON’T DON’T DON’T \r\nDon't try to use Treasury as an opportunity to cash out, no matter what you've paid in the past.
