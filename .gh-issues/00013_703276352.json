    "body": "> All \"ASIC-resistant\" coins end either with ASICs (ethereum, litecoin, decred, dash, grin, etc.etc.etc.)\r\n\r\nThat's entirely misleading regarding Grin. Grin has dual PoW; one ASIC-friendly (Cuckatoo), and one ASIC-resistant (Cuckaroo) for the first two years only. The latter is tweaked every 6 months, and has never had ASICs developed for it. All Grin ASIC development has been for the ASIC friendly variant.\r\n\r\nI agree that without frequent tweaking, no PoW can remain ASIC resistant...",
