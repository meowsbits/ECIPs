    "body": "> It proposes changing ethash (a complete consensus engine) for keccak-256, a hashing function, and does not at all go in to detail regarding the rest of the consensus engine. As is, blocktimes, monetary policy, hashing function(s), difficulty algo, ghost protocol/uncles, DAG/caches, block validation and sealing are all part of the ethash consensus engine. Disabling or removing ethash, disables/removes ALL of this.\r\n\r\nNonsense! Replacing the PoW algorithm (as opposed to misleadingly suggesting its removal) in no way affects all these other buzz-words you throw in willy nilly.\r\n",
