    "body": "Just my 2 cents.\r\n\r\n**@recurvolution**: About the liquid value, there are many changes going on in these days. I know mining sites which restored etc autoexchange to btc, so you can mine ETC today being paid in btc or deciding to keep mined ETCs to change them later for better value. I think that exchanges won't take long to come back to normal aswsell.\r\n\r\n**@slavserver**: actually, talking about GPUs, the best ROIs belong to Radeon R9 FURY 4gb and RX470 4gb cards. A modern 6/8gb card consumes less power but its own ROI, even with higher hashrates, is at least 15-20x times more. Sure, one can take into consideration the reselling value of the newer hardware but to do what? To buy newer gpus @ higher prices with same (or worst) ROI? Radeon VII teached many, and I was one of those.  Perhaps one at that point could buy one or more ASICs, but then, with reduced DAG, some \"old fashioned\" fellows such as  E3s will come back into play with awesome ROI. Another one:  ASICs for a low-rate increasing DAG size coin will be more appealing for both developers and miners. I really don't get your points. Sorry.\r\n",
