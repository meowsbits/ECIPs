    "body": "I'm changing my opinion on the _arbitrary hex code_ feature. It's too generic. \r\n\r\nThere's no way we need to be supporting  every possible thematic change just because your wimpy eyes hurt. If you want dark mode you can wear sunglasses like the rest of us. \r\n\r\nWill your magic thematic changes support Explorer? Will Explorer support you?  Does Solidity support CSS named colors? If not, why not. We need to consider the ecosystem, and we need due diligence, more developers, and we need about 14 more roadmaps than you have proposed thus far. \r\n",
