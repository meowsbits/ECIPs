    "body": "> Ideally, we need at least two more ECIP editors. An ideal candidate should be well-recognized in the Ethereum Classic community and widely acting independently.\r\n\r\nAs one of the active `independent` contributers, I'd be happy to help secure the Ethereum Classic governance as one of the ECIP Editor positions. You can review my commits throughout this github organization to gauge value added contributions. I typically check once a week to clear any PRs in the ethereumclassic.org repo, So this wouldn't be too much of an additional burden to help review/process the ECIP procedural formalities.\r\n\r\n@TheEnthusiasticAs is also quite active and would be a great `independent`  addition.",
