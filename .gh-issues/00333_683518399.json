    "body": "There is no use making payments after 80k confirmations, this because the payments sent during the attack (reorg) disappeared, the balance did not reach its destination or return to the issuer, then\r\n90k confirmations => does not work\r\n80k confirmations => does not work\r\n10k confirmations => does not work\r\nThis happens because the output of the coins was registered from a wallet_A to a wallet_B, but after that registration a \"reorg\" was generated where the TXNs do not exist, the coins sent are lost, these coins never reach their destination and these coins also do not return to the issuer .... and you want to wait a year to implement SHA3 instead of implementing pirlGuard and / or checkpoints or even inject hashrate from nicehash with your resources (developers), you should do this today .. ... you (developers) are children playing developer ..... ETC was better off without you. good luck kids!",
