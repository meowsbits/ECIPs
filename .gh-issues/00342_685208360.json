    "body": "## I am totally against this proposal.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why this proposal must be rejected:\r\n\r\n1. It is unnecessary because it does not propose to improve any aspect of the Ethereum CLassic project. It only proposes to change things without actually improving anything.\r\n\r\n2. It goes directly against the principle of decentralization and neutrality.\r\n\r\nThis proposal goes stright against the principles of the network because SHA-3 is an ASIC-friendly algorithm. ASICs will lead to centralization of mining power. This goes against the [Crypto Decentralists Manifesto](https://medium.com/@bit_novosti/a-crypto-decentralist-manifesto-6ba1fa0b9ede).\r\n\r\n>It’s impossible to achieve these blockchain characteristics without the system being truly decentralized. If any aspect of the blockchain system becomes subject to centralized control, this introduces an attack vector enabling the violation of one or more of the key blockchain characteristics. \r\n\r\n>Without neutrality, the system is skewed towards one set of participants at the expense of others. In that case, it’s less likely to gain universal acceptance and maximize network value for everyone.\r\n\r\nIn case of adopting the SHA-3 mining algorithm the system will be definitely skewed to the benefit of ASIC owners. GPU mining is more decentralized than ASIC mining.\r\n\r\n### The \"Rationale\" of this proposal is completely improper\r\n\r\n>Enhanced security: Sha-3 is the latest member of the Secure Hash Algorithm family of standards and certified by the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) [2].\r\n\r\nYes it is true. However it has nothing to do with the Ethereum CLassic, the network and the mining algo. **This phrase is just a fact. It is not a proper rationale to change things. It is not a description of any benefit that the network will get from adopting this ECIP.**\r\n\r\n>Reduced risk of non-compliance: Software agreements can have complex compliance criteria and compliance audits can be time consuming or simply a deal-breaker. Having a standardized cryptographic hash function would reduce the risk of non-compliance as vanilla Sha-3 is certified by trusted organizations and has been thoroughly vetted to obtain its place in the Sha family [3].\r\n\r\nThis is fact as well. Not a rationale for changing the mining algo.\r\n\r\n>Enhanced productivity: Sha-3 is a solidified cryptographic function with certification and documentation. This reduces research and maintenance costs for engineers especially since Sha-3 ASIC chip designs are available.\r\n\r\nASIC-friendly mining algorithms are not what a decentralized network must adopt.\r\n\r\n>Less PoW Competition: There are no major public blockchains whom use Sha-3 for PoW. Ethereum Classic's current market status to adopt Sha-3 would make it the majority chain for its respective PoW without having to compete in existing PoW ecosystems for miners.\r\n\r\nIt is a double edged sword. Not only ETC will gain a status of \"unique\" mining chain but also it will become incompatible with ETH mining hardware which represents a significant part of the hashpower market.",
