    "body": "This proposal currently appears incomplete. \r\n\r\nIt proposes changing ethash (a complete consensus engine) for keccak-256, a hashing function, and does not at all go in to detail regarding the rest of the consensus engine. As is, blocktimes, monetary policy, hashing function(s), difficulty algo, ghost protocol/uncles, DAG/caches, block validation and sealing are all part of the ethash consensus engine. Disabling or removing ethash, disables/removes ALL of this.\r\n\r\nIf the proposal is proposing to replace ethash, it should cover the entire engine, not just one componenet of it. Otherwise it should be proposed as a modification to the existing engine (ethash).",
