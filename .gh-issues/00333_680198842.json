    "body": "Please add \"ECIP-1043 - Fix DAG size limit restriction\" to the agenda for Friday's call.\r\nhttps://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1043\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/11\r\n\r\nTo attract 4GB miners from ETH to ETC and to secure the network by becoming the dominant blockchain in our mining pool, we must alter the ethash algorithm by setting a limit on the DAG size. This will have the political effect of gathering support for the blockchain from those with mining hardware that will be unusable on ETH, as well as prepare ourselves for what will be necessary to switch to another algorithm once this antiquated hardware is rendered completely obsolete.",
