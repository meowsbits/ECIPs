    "body": "My proposal is that the longest chain should be accepted by most nodes, the method to use should be that if 95% of the nodes have height N while the longest chain has height N+1 then that chain must be rejected, this can be achieved by adding masternodes to ETC and any security masternodes must be active for more than 5000 blocks, in this way the attack will be rejected, so a masternode that is active for less than 5000 blocks does not have the capacity to certify if a chain is or is not true\r\n\r\nIf we have 100 masternodes certifying the chain (A) as the original then the attacker will need + 51% hashrate and also 2000 own masternodes, this implies high collateral (large investment and high risk)\r\n\r\nThis encourages staking, reduces money, generates commercial demand for the currency\r\n\r\nmasternode = node PoS\r\nPoS/PoW hybrid\r\n",
