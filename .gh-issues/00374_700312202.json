    "body": "I am not sure understand the tradeoffs correctly. Does MESS reduce the global (e.g affecting all participants) vulnerability to attackers with temporary access to hash power at the expense of increasing local vulnerability (e.g affecting a single participant) to attackers that can manipulate network traffic and successfully bifurcate victims from the Internet?\r\n\r\nIn other words, what effect would MESS have on the total hash power needed for the attacker to appear as the preferred chain for a particular victim or subset of victims, assuming the attacker can eclipse them at will? \r\n\r\n",
