    "body": "> Who knows when ETH 2.0 will happen. But I wouldn't like to stake everything on the assumption that ETH 1.0 disappears. I've got a strong feeling that their PoW chain will continue.\r\n\r\nMy issue with your logic is that you give a 100% monopoly to Epic Blockchain on the entire network of Ethereum Classic and all of its inflation `until the supply chain for SHA3 ASIC matures to a point of being decantralized.` Surely, you can see the risks in this are far greater than a 24 hour reorg.\r\n\r\nSo ECIP-1049 and ECIP-1095 reaction to the 51% attacks is to accept a huge centralization of the ETC network, then HOPE the tech developed on the network via a treasury stimulates market forces to decentralize that massive `centralized supply chain` hole in the SHA3 path.\r\n\r\nThis is a $1B network, we can not be leaving the network centralized in this manner until a supply chain matures. ALL of your ideas are great on a NEW PROJECT where the market is trying to find its valuation. ETC is simply too mature of a network and the supply chain you're attempting to pivot to is too immature, that is what makes this change so irresponsible.",
