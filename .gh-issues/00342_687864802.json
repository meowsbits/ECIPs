    "body": "> 1. The objection argument \"the centralization by one ASIC manufacturer\":\r\n>    If there will be a demand for such devices, other companies will start to manufacture these, too. It is how a market work. Supply and demand. As it is easy to produce, based on the argument of the original championer of the SHA3/Keccak for the Ethereum Classic, the prices would also be relatively affordable.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy issue with your logic is that you give a 100% monopoly to Epic Blockchain on the entire network of Ethereum Classic and all of its inflation `until the supply chain for SHA3 ASIC matures to a point of being decantralized.` Surely, you can see the risks in this are far greater than a 24 hour reorg.\r\n\r\nSo ECIP-1049 and ECIP-1095 reaction to the 51% attacks is to accept a huge centralization of the ETC network, then HOPE the tech developed on the network via a treasury stimulates market forces to decentralize that massive `centralized supply chain` hole in the SHA3 path.\r\n\r\nThis is a $1B network, we can not be leaving the network centralized in this manner until a supply chain matures. ALL of your ideas are great on a NEW PROJECT where the market is trying to find its valuation. ETC is simply too mature of a network and the supply chain you're attempting to pivot to is too immature, that is what makes this change so irresponsible.\r\n\r\n> 3. The objection \"it does not protect against the relatively large reorganizations in the network\":\r\n>    Nobody said, that **it will**. What was said, is, that it will give a chance to be a major blockchain with this algorithm. This project is popular. Higher the algo standard, more attractive it will get, more (serious) people would be interested to do on/with this project, value would go higher, more miners would join, more secure the network would be, fewer the chance the network would have relatively large reorganizations.\r\n\r\nYes, this was being sold as a 51% attack solution. And it is being prioritized AHEAD of legitimate 51% attack solutions. I'm glad the pro-SHA3 side is at least now re-messaging that this is NOT a solution to 51% attacks. But do not mistakes, this was sold as a 51% solution in 2019. And it was sold as a 51% solution until about one week ago when the messaging changed.",
