    "body": ">IOHK Commentary on desire to have technical demostrations and Q&A with the PirlGuard team\r\n\r\nI would like to express my desire to finally have a **TECHNICAL CONVERSATION** with IOHK regarding their proposal becuase there is a lot of \"marketing movements\" around their proposal but not even a single place to handle technical discussion in a written form. IOHK promotes its proposal bypassing the ECIP procedure thus not giving anyone a chance to criticize their proposal. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion it is necessary to submit a github issue for the discussion of Checkpointing right now. Later we can link this already-existing discussion to the submitted ECIP as soon as IOHK will proceed with the ECIP PR.\r\n\r\n>Perhaps these teams can setup a YouTube live meeting and explain their approaches to each other. Seems like a productive conversation to have between development teams and a great recording for vested parties to observe.\r\n\r\nWe have a ECIP procedure in place for a reason. In my opinion the technical description is sufficient for proper understanding of the proposed solution. I'm ready to answer any questions and address any concerns here in github. If IOHK or other teams would like to understand the proposal then they are welcome to submit their questions here.\r\n\r\nAgain - we already have a ECIP procedure defined. YouTube video conversations could be good but these are completely optional and these have nothing to do with the submitted proposal. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice if someone with proper understanding of EPIC-1092 will make a video explanation for others. cc @masterdubs @chrisfranko @gitr0n1n \r\n\r\n> to your point about a detail technical discussion on possible 51% attack solutions (Do nothing, Checkpointing, PirlGuard, VeriBlock). Perhaps pre-recorded or YouTube live convo outside of the CDC channels where your teams control the time allocation and can provide a proper platform to discuss the technical merits of the proposals. Eliminate the third-party moderation with self-moderation.\r\n\r\nGithub is the most proper platform to discuss **technical** merits of the proposals without any third-party moderation and other teams controlling the time allocation etc.\r\n\r\nPlacing a requirement to participate in live conversations or have a video is completely optional and it has nothing to do with ECIP procedure i.e. it is pure marketing of your team/ advertisement of your proposal. \r\n\r\n**For technical discussion and decision making, this is as redundant as requiring everyone to have a description of our proposals in Latin just because one team's expert is familiar with Latin and that team might be comfortable relying on Latin.**\r\n\r\nNot to mention that my ECIP got directly censored by the owner of the \"official\" @eth_classic Twitter account:\r\n\r\n1. [I have submitted a Tweet highlighting this ECIP 1092](https://discord.com/channels/223674353001168906/372015733539995658/741628811803885649) (provided a link to the Pull Request and this github issue) on 8/8/2020. There is a special #please_retweet channel for the announcements via the official twitter account and I have submitted my request there.\r\n\r\n2. [8/11/2020 I have requested the announcement of my ECIP 1092 again](https://discord.com/channels/223674353001168906/372015733539995658/742745956591861890).\r\n\r\n3.  08/16/2020 I asked why my proposal is not being announced and who controls the account at the moment. I got no response so far.\r\n\r\n4. I thought that this tweet may be incorrect because it was submitted before the ECIP number was assigned and this was the reason for not retweeting it. Then [I have submitted a new request 8/18/2020](https://discord.com/channels/223674353001168906/372015733539995658/745195291770093588).\r\n\r\nAt the same time other members of ETC community were constantly submitting their requests to the #please_retweet channel and their requests were announced. Also, the proposal of IOHK is being announced multiple times with this exact account.\r\n\r\nIt looks like a direct censorship of my proposal (which is still not announced as if it does not exist) and marketing pressure by those who have control over the official account. I don't think that the reason behind not submitting a tweet about **ECIP-1092 solution to the most relevant attack** is that it is not an important problem of the network and the project. Just someone have an employee controlling a common account of the project that is intended to highlight all proposals and announce any activity while in fact this account is being used to directly promote chosen solutions and censor the others.\r\n\r\nAgain, we all have the same procedure of submitting and discussing proposals - it is called [ECIP procedure](\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/mikeyb/455f2adb46a56ca2f4cc80049e7b5adc). All teams would be in the same position if we relied on this procedure. I highly recommend everyone to stick to the ECIP procedure further without any extra requirements which can only limit the number of actual participants but not benefit the decision making process.\r\n\r\n>I'd love to see them do videos and have a QA presentation for their solutions\r\n\r\nI'd love Charles to adhere to ECIP procedure finally. Or at least create discussion for IOHK proposal.\r\nAs for QA - we have this exact github issue thread for this purpose.\r\n\r\n>I'd love to participate and see proper ECIPs\r\n\r\nOur ECIPs are proper while IOHK do not even have an ECIP.\r\n\r\n>Stop with the noise everyone, let's follow a process and get this done\r\n\r\nYes! IOHK please, follow the [ECIP process](\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/mikeyb/455f2adb46a56ca2f4cc80049e7b5adc) and submit an issue for **TRANSPARENT** technical discussion.\r\n\r\nAlso, I would be happy to answer any questions here on github following the ECIP procedure. I would be happy to answer any questions by email dexaran820@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to provide all the necessary information regarding this ECIP to anyone who will express a desire to make a presentation, participate in a video call or YouTube conversation on my behalf. \r\n\r\nI'm ready to collaborate but please, let's stick to the already defined process instead of inventing something that is only convenient for one team on the fly.",
