    "body": "@soc1c Please could I suggest the following updates to \"options\":\r\n\r\n1. Note that [ECIP-1061 \"phoenix\": aztlan as vanilla istanbul](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/280) is not just \"very unlikely\" but is actually Withdrawn and off the table.   So is not something we would have as an option to discuss.\r\n\r\n2. Note that [ECIP-1079: Phoenix \"redo\"](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1079) is not just \"unlikely\" but is also Withdrawn and off the table.  PR is pending.\r\n\r\n3. Note that [ECIP-1078: Phoenix \"fix\"](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1078) is \"likely\" and is in Last Call status.  PR is pending.   I was under the delusion that ECIPs needed to be in Last Call for two weeks, but as per ECIP-1000 that is not the case at all.    IMHO we should propose activation dates BEFORE the call, so we have a timeline to say YES/NO to.   A sensible timeline should be agreed by rough consensus of the client developers here on Github, not \"on the fly\" in the meeting and then get \"blessed\" on the call.",
