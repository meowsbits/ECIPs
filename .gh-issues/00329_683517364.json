    "body": "> RandomX is CPU mining, so botnets will take over the network, do you want that?\r\n\r\n>> Does RandomX facilitate botnets/malware mining or web mining?\r\nDue to the way the algorithm works, mining malware is much easier to detect. RandomX Sniffer is a proof of concept tool that can detect illicit mining activity on Windows.\r\n\r\n>> Efficient mining requires more than 2 GiB of memory, which also disqualifies many low-end machines such as IoT devices, which are often parts of large botnets.\r\n\r\n>> Web mining is infeasible due to the large memory requirement and the lack of directed rounding support for floating point operations in both Javascript and WebAssembly.`\r\n\r\nLinking a section of the proposal that references this botnets concern for RandomX.",
