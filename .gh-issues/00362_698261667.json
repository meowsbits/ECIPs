    "body": "> Thanks for adding ECIP 1096. We'll be there to present and respond to questions. What is your idea? How much time will be assigned to ECIP 1096 ?\r\n\r\nSo, first thing will be finalizing ECIP 1099 which is in last call and we need to update the block numbers to allow for Besu to implement the changes and second part will be discussing the \"51% proposals.\"\r\n\r\nIn the end we will have to decide for one as we _most likely_ will not implement all of them and the core devs have to evaluate if it's sufficient to just implement one protective measure or whether we need multiple.\r\n\r\nThe community sentiment appears to either favor 1092 \"Pirlguard\" by Callisto or the 1100 \"MESS\" proposal by the ETC Core working group. The discussion on 1092 was cut off last time, unfortunately, so we will start with that and also allow for comparing with the other proposals.\r\n\r\nWhat we could do, because it's five different proposals, that I ask 3-4 questions that each proposal champion has to answer and this will allow us to create some matrix of what the proposals do, what they don't do, and what they require. I'll come up with something by tomorrow.",
