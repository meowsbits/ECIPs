    "body": "> > We need to move beyond Ethash to be our own giant. Yes - there are concerns that miners have over the equipment they have invested in - 100% get that - but just because you have GPU rigs doesn't mean the overall future of the project should be limited to only use those.\r\n> \r\n> I get this, but why not take advantage of all that GPU hashpower that will soon(ish) no longer be mining ETH?\r\n> \r\n> If the objection to retaining Ethash is that it is not secure enough, now or in the near future, to reduce the risk of a 51% attack to an acceptable level then that is a strong arguement for change. Is this the case though? If not and the argument for change is something other than attack prevention then I remain to be convinced.\r\n\r\nFor the short term there is the ECIP-1043 #11, which had no objection till now, is in the last call and would satisfy all the participating groups of the network.",
