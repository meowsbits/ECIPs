    "body": "> Well, Just few worlds. In Italy you pay 0,23â‚¬/kW. This Is the reasons why I had choosen RX 470 gpus (48w/26mh) @ Wall 8 x 470 + sys l+/- 500w x 200 mh. Eth Is going pos, 4 gb cards left with ravencoins. I understand all reasons above, but looking @ me this would be another chance.\r\n\r\nYes that is a good point, I'm a small miner with 200 GPU's most of them 4 GB I have been mining ETC for 2 years now, I know many people in similar situation, doing the DAG calibration will prevent 51% attack's at least till we switch to SHA 3, Its good for both parties that's just my opinion.\r\n\r\nThanks guys",
