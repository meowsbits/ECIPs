    "body": "There may be some confusion here, the original seedHash function left room for inconsistencies, some areas called seedHash simply by passing a blocknumber (any blocknumber), where elsewhere an epoch boundary was always being passed, (epoch*epochLength+1). These inconsistencies resulted in a bug for the second half of a new epochs. This was addressed in the last core-geth release, refactoring seedHash to avoid this kind of inconsistent usage (now accepts an epoch and an epochLength and calculates the block). https://github.com/etclabscore/core-geth/blob/master/consensus/ethash/algorithm.go#L143\r\n\r\n\r\nSide note: this fork of ethminer https://github.com/etclabscore/ethminer works post thanos.",
