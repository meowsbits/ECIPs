    "body": "@q9f Thank you for the offer, but it appears CDC 14 is related to 51% attacks and there likely won't be enough time to adequately address the CDC 15 topics.\r\n\r\nThe during the last 3 calls relate to ECIP-1049 the proposal has not been in a finalized state to even begin the formal opposition conversation. it likely should have been left in draft status to iron out the details, but that's okay because it is in Last Call status until at least October 9th.\r\n\r\nNow that the ECIP-1049 is more finalized by the authors due to CDC 13. It is appropriate to have this CDC 15 conversation. You're welcome to join the conversation. I'll be moderating/recording to assure there is ample time for the authors to address the documented concerns/opposition. The author of ECIP-1049 has agreed to be present to answer the opposition on video.",
