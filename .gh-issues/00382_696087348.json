    "body": "@q9f Thank you for the offer, but it appears CDC 14 is related to 51% attacks and there likely won't be enough time to adequately address the CDC 15 topics.\r\n\r\nDuring the last 3 CDC calls relate to ECIP-1049 the proposal was not in a `finalized` state to even begin the Formal Opposition conversation. It likely should have been left in `Draft` status to iron out the details of the proposal, but that's okay because it is in `Last Call` status until at least October 9th and an `Accepted` proposal could still be `Rejected` if the opposition's concerns are material enough.\r\n\r\nNow that the ECIP-1049 is `finalized` by the authors due to CDC 13, it is appropriate to have this CDC 15 opposition conversation. You're welcome to join the conversation. I'll be moderating/recording to assure there is ample time for the authors to address the documented concerns/opposition and work to form consensus like the ECIP suggests. The author of ECIP-1049 has agreed to be present to answer the opposition on voice/recording. I've informed him of the approach of the call so he has ample time to prepare responses and won't be in a \"gotcha\" situation. Thanks for all your hard work lately.",
