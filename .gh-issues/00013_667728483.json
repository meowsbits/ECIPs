    "body": "No idea. But lets do the math. That FPGA will run at up 400MHz (maximum) and has sufficient logic elements and routing fabric to accommodate a full 24 stage pipeline, so one hash per clock. That's at most 400MH/sec. a far cry from the advertised 2GH/sec. Theoretically they could have five such pipelines running in parallel, but I doubt that would fit on said FPGA. So you're right, something doesn't add up!",
