Perhaps pre-recorded or YouTube live convo outside of the CDC channels where your teams control the time allocation and can provide a proper platform to discuss the technical merits of the proposals. Eliminate the third-party moderation with self-moderation. @masterdubs | Pirl founder\r\n\r\niogcharlesToday at xx:12 xx\r\nIf anyone has contacts with Pirlguard and veriblock could you forward them to me\r\nI'd love to see them do videos and have a QA presentation for their solutions\r\nI'd love to participate and see proper ECIPs\r\nso we have a set of 3 well defined options\r\nPM me if anyone has them\r\nStop with the noise everyone, let's follow a process and get this done\r\n\r\n@Dexaran ^",
