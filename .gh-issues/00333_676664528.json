    "body": "I would suggest to also consider PoW changes that leave the hashimoto algorithm (the \"core\") intact but change the PoW results through using a different DAG, similar to how Ubiq achieved some degree of separation from ET*. There would be more than one way to achieve such a DAG change: one could just change the seed value (currently 0), follow Ubiq's example, or implement ECIP-1043. The latter would also help to retain miners currently mining ETC, and accelerate the expected migration of miners from ETH to ETC. Such a change is likely to be compatible with any existing ETC mining equipment, and would \"only\" require an update of the mining software. (Note that deploying such an update would still require a major effort, and any solutions that don't involve touching PoW at all would therefore be preferable.)\r\nSuch a simple PoW change would provide a weak barrier, that should nevertheless leave anyone who'd facilitate overcoming it in an ethically as well as legally difficult position. This in turn should serve to limit the instruments available to future attackers.",
