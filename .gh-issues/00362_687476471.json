    "body": "Has ECIP-1092 scheduled their presentation? https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/364\r\n\r\nThe ECIP-1097 presentation was today https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/361 and ECIP-1043 is humming along in `Last Call` status https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/11 .\r\n\r\nAssuming @Dexaran and the people presenting ECIP-1092 are comfortable presenting their proposal prior to 9/11 and think the community will have sufficient time to digest the material, then I think you can make a case for a rushed 9/11 meeting for the ECIP-1049 timeline.\r\n\r\nBut then we have to fit the ECIP-1049 discussion on top of the 51% conversation. Which is a very large meeting with high impact on the network. it will likely be one of the biggest meetings Ethereum Classic has ever held. While it might not be an exceptional day and may result in surpressed turnout, is a satisfactory date and could be poetic due to the significance of 9/11. So there is that element to the idea.\r\n\r\nI personally am a bit more conservative and think the general public needs more time to digest the material, as they are not likely as plugged in as all of us. That is why I think 9/25 was a good alternative by @q9f. Also i think if we try to jam too many important large topic ECIPs in this meeting we will lose focus and the ECIPs at the end of the meeting will likely suffer proper discussion due to time constraints.",
