    "body": "Has ECIP-1092 scheduled their presentation?\r\n\r\nThe ECIP-1097 presentation was today and ECIP-1043 is humming along in `last Call`.\r\n\r\nAssuming @Dexaran and the people presenting ECIP-1092 are comfortable presenting their proposal prior to 9/11 and think the community will have sufficient time to digest the material, then I thik you can make a case the 9/11, while not an exceptional day and may result in surpressed turnout, is a satisfactory date.\r\n\r\nI personally am a bit more conservative and think the general public needs more time to digest the material, as they are not likely as plugged in as all of us. That is why I think 9/25 was a good alternative by @q9f and have thanked him prsonally for that and acknowledged his ability to hear the feedback of the process.\r\n\r\nMy voice has been expressed. I'll let the process work itself out now.",
