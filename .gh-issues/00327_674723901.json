    "body": "IMHO, ETC is selling itself as a more conservative alternative to ETH: by keeping PoW, by not having infinite inflation (like the 1st blockchain: BTC). Deploying this would go completely against this narrative, because this looks like a very experimental thing (has any other blockchain adopted this?). Also, given that ETH is switching to PoS very soon, we might get a new influx of PoW miners on ETC chain, which would decrease the feasibility of more 51% attacks.",
