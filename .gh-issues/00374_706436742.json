    "body": "I am sorry to say that we have had to abort implementation of MESS within the Besu client.\r\n\r\n1. The specification is largely defined using code snippets from Core-Geth, rather than being a free-standing specification.\r\n2. Given that Core-Geth's code really is the specification, we would end up having to implement the same logic in Besu with bug-for-bug behaviour.\r\n3. All of that Core-Geth code is LGPL-encumbered.  Besu implementation from that code would be considered a derived work which is also subject to LGPL licensing.  That is unacceptable for Besu which has permissive Apache 2.0 licensing.\r\n4. There is no test-suite defined.\r\n\r\nFurther, MESS has already been deployed and will be active on ETC mainnet imminently.   Even if the licensing and test-suite issues above were later resolved and MESS support was subsequently added to Besu, we would have to hope that nothing much changed based on multi-client implementation and multi-client testing of MESS, because the feature is already live.  Changing behaviour after the fact could be very messy.\r\n\r\nThe same problems stand for Mantis, which is also Apache 2.0 licensed.\r\n\r\nGiven that most (all?) mining nodes are Core-Geth, the lack of MESS support in Besu might not make much practical difference.   If the Core-Geth nodes with MESS support successfully defend against 51% attacks, the Besu nodes would be eventually consistent, along with non-MESS Core-Geth nodes.\r\n",
