    "body": "TL;DR: I am open and supportive of a treasury system for development. I am not sold on ALL of the mechanics and think those details need to be ironed out in a more collaborative way in a follow up discussion. My vote is greenlight on an embedded treasury system.\r\n\r\nAdding my opinions on wax due to the likely scenereo that I don't have adequate service to attend the meeting live (I'll be in the woods, a trip scheduled far in advance of this meeting):\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to stress that I have voluntarily been exploring this specific topic since January 2020 when I first dug in deeply and saw the state of development in ETC. I also want to stress that I am not a protocol level developer.\r\n\r\nAs we see with inactive dev teams coming back into the ETC ecosystem, a Treasury system can bring in more development talent due to funding assurance to teams that want to assemble Long Term Support outfits. Our current funding mechanics are HIGHLY centralized and lack transparency (although ETC Coop is doing great work to try to be as transparent as possible). There are huge security risks in the current funding models that simply can not be ignored as ETC moves forward down its own, unique roadmap.\r\n\r\nSome posts I made when digging into the inactive `CommunityFund` and exploring appetite for revenue stream capture to reduce network development dependency on these centralized funding sources:\r\n\r\n* \"This project is SEVERELY under funded and there does not appear to be any decentralized effort to fund it.\" - my post from January in the `CommunityFund` channel.\r\n\r\n* \"it's kind of lunacy to prefer backroom meetings for funding the open source project, rather than an extremely transparent, public way imo.\" - my post from January in the `CommunityFund` channel.\r\n\r\n* \"Rough idea: We can build funding sources by porting over high value dapps like uniswap and including a development fee/tax in those. These are public goods that can feed useage funds to the DAO. Then the DAO solicits to build another public good that has a similar development fee built in. A positive feedback loop. Effectively the public good dapps increase the use cases for the network appreciating ETC's utility. Which increases the transaction counts per block which is more revenue for the miners. And if the public good is generating funding for development, the DAO will now be able to feed developers. So now a long term sustainable model starts forming.\" - my post from May in the `CommunityFund` channel.\r\n\r\n* \"Nothing wrong with VC money, but if its the sole way to support development, they will be calling all shots. I really suggest people in this room take a look at the Monero funding mechs and how they support a full time cryptography PhD. There is lot to learn there, just as we are learning from ETH with solutions like MolachDAO. Personally my belief is the more avenues for developers to feed their families and contribute to this truly decentralized EVM, the better. VC + DAOs + public good useage revenue generators (uniswap, defi, liquidity pools) + product/services kicking in (blockstream or grayscale approach) + bounties (gitcoin) + community pooling (monero) + miners kicking in (voluntarily) + many more approaches. I'm open for anything that pushes for feeding developers and facilitating  a postive feedback loop that will appreciate ETC value/utility.\" - my post from May in the `CommunityFund` channel.\r\n\r\nSecurity Perspective:\r\nThere is currently NO decentralized long term solution for protocol level development support, this is a huge security risk as we lean more heavily on ETC specific developers after the Phoenix parity goal was accomplished in June 2020.\r\n- ETC Coop has cited that they feel underfunded and are simply don't have adequate funding to pursue all of their goals and the network needs. Example: SHA-3 testing.\r\n- ETC Core develpers have cited that they have ample funding from ETC Labs. This is wonderful to hear and I applaud James Wo's donation to open source development. There are inherent security risks leaning solely on the donations of a private funding source: donations may run dry, the funding source may have difference incentives than the network and its ecosystem, developers and their project are dependant on the private funding sources approval. This is centralization of development and what we should be working to get away from. So how do we do that?\r\n\r\nTreasury System:\r\nI am a fan of a treasury system to support decentralized development on ETC. Having a treasury has the potential to attract dev talent that we don't even know about. We will likely see many more ECIPs with innovative tech for this specific application of blockchain; be it L1 or L2 proposals. I personally see a lot more pros than cons.\r\n\r\nI am a fan of a funding system that's sole purpose is to advance the network itself. The Developers funding pool would be replenished by their ability to produce products that fill blocks (increased user usage). This appreciates the value prop of the network and aligns Developers and Miners incentives.\r\n\r\nA L1 example, there is a community desire for Account Versioning and no present development talent to champion this idea. A treasury would incentivize developers to meet the unanswered needs of the non-developer community. Currently, the active development teams have no signaled intent to work on this highly requested feature that will add backwards compatibility to the network.\r\n\r\nI agree with @Dexaran that L2 Smart Contracts can fund a majority of these funding mechs. But since ETC is still at that L1 focus, I'm not opposed to a baseline L1 portion of the inflation going to the developer. This will ensure that if blocks are being mined, development will be funded in a way that is solely reliant on the network (until the emission is 0); a big move away from third-party dependency (ETC Coop & ETC Labs models of funding development) which I view as a step in the right direction for decentralization of powers and segregation of duties in the ecosystem. Current material development funding comes from James Wo and Barry Silbert's private businesses. Let's add \"the public ETC Network\" to that list with a built in treasury system and remove third-party dependency for ETC development.\r\n\r\nA L2 example, there is an entire DeFi ecosystem that can be ported over to ETC with a dev funding mech built into its foundation. Currently ETH DeFi teams are extorting the third-party ETC money to \"Add ETC Support\". Heresay: I believe Uniswap wanted something like a million dollars to add ETC, this is not a feasibly approach. Also it is not logical to pay extortion fees when this network can fund this development and link into existing networks due to the permissionless nature of blockchains.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnknowns that I can not commit support for due to lack of knowledge and understanding at this moment:\r\n- I do not know the mechanics of the governance system Charles discussed \"Voltaire\".\r\n- I am hesitant to introduce a hybrid PoW/PoS model because I don't understand how this works yet. Also I am reluctant to any PoS due to so many poor implementations of it.",
