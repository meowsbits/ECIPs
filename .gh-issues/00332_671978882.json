    "body": "\"Nothing wrong with VC money, but if its the sole way to support development, they will be calling all shots. I really suggest people in this room take a look at the Monero funding mechs and how they support a full time cryptography PhD. There is lot too learn there, just as we are learning from ETH with solutions like MolachDAO.\r\n\r\nPersonally my belief is the more avenues for developers to feed their families and contribute to this truly decentralized EVM, the better. VC + DAOs + public good useage revenue generators (uniswap, defi, liquidity pools) + product/services kicking in (blockstream or grayscale approach) + bounties (gitcoin) + community pooling (monero) + miners kicking in (voluntarily) + many more approaches. I'm open for anything that pushes for feeding developers and facilitating  a postive feedback loop that will appreciate ETC value/utility.\" - my post from May in the `community fund` channel.\r\n\r\nI think https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/231 highlights centralization in development.",
