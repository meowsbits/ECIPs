    "body": "I think https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/229 highlights centralization in development. As we see with inactive dev teams coming back into the ETC ecosystem, a Treasury system can bring in more development talent and give assurance to teams that want to bring Long Term Support. Our current funding mechanics are HIGHLY centralized and lack transparency, we can only go UP from the current funding situation.\r\n\r\nSome posts I made when digging into the inactive `CommunityFund` and exploring appetitie for revenue stream capture to reduce network development dependency on these centralized funding sources:\r\n\r\n* \"This project is SEVERELY under funded and there does not appear to be any decentralized effort to fund it.\" - my post from January in the `CommunityFund` channel.\r\n\r\n* \"it's kind of lunacy to prefer backroom meetings for funding the open source project, rather than an extremely transparent, public way imo.\" - my post from January in the `CommunityFund` channel.\r\n\r\n* \"Rough idea: We can build funding sources by porting over high value dapps like uniswap and including a development fee/tax in those. These are public goods that can feed useage funds to the DAO. Then the DAO solicits to build another public good that has a similar development fee built in. A positive feedback loop. Effectively the public good dapps increase the use cases for the network appreciating ETC's utility. Which increases the transaction counts per block which is more revenue for the miners. And if the public good is generating funding for development, the DAO will now be able to feed developers. So now a long term sustainable model starts forming.\" - my post from May in the `CommunityFund` channel.\r\n\r\n* \"Nothing wrong with VC money, but if its the sole way to support development, they will be calling all shots. I really suggest people in this room take a look at the Monero funding mechs and how they support a full time cryptography PhD. There is lot to learn there, just as we are learning from ETH with solutions like MolachDAO. Personally my belief is the more avenues for developers to feed their families and contribute to this truly decentralized EVM, the better. VC + DAOs + public good useage revenue generators (uniswap, defi, liquidity pools) + product/services kicking in (blockstream or grayscale approach) + bounties (gitcoin) + community pooling (monero) + miners kicking in (voluntarily) + many more approaches. I'm open for anything that pushes for feeding developers and facilitating  a postive feedback loop that will appreciate ETC value/utility.\" - my post from May in the `CommunityFund` channel.",
