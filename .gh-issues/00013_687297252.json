    "body": "I am going to document this in this thread for \"on the record\" conversation on the topic. If the SHA3 proponents ignore the opposition to ECIP-1049 and ECIP-1095 by a material group of ETC participants, there will be a contentious hard fork between Ethash and SHA3 factions. It would be in the preference of the Ethash side that the SHA3 side acknowledge there is an opposition to this proposal and withdraw their proposal. If they insist on pushing through their SHA3 agenda, they will be responsible for triggering the second chain split of the Ethereum Classic network.\r\n\r\nThe incumbent Ethash faction is a decentralized body, unlike the centralized participants that are pushing the SHA3 agenda (Commonwealth.gg and ETC Coop). So the Ethash opposition will likely take more time to formally organize their opposition into this ECIP process. However, at this moment there are many miners and developers vocally commiting to the Ethash side via Discord #mining channel.\r\n\r\nHere is a noteworthy message that confirms the non-fork Ethash side of the discussion will maintain development talent and has laid out a tangible approach to stabalizing the network in perpetuity:\r\n\r\n> dexaranToday at X:13 AM\r\n> @Alfonsoponcho Yes, old chain and go with ECIP-1043 route. much more favorable apporach to GPU and network security\r\n> @r0n1n In case there will be a split on the ground of Sha3-ECIP I'd like to commit my support to the Ethash chain.\r\n\r\n> I would say that I have \r\n> (1) a development team capable of maintaining the protocol and infrastructure, \r\n> (2) the solution to 51%attack that can be implemented right ahead i.e. ECIP1092, \r\n> (3) the plan to introduce a Treasruy system for longterm sustainability of the chain - we can just pick the ECIP 1098 and stick with it for that time, \r\n> (4) a working concept of a Security Auditing Department DAO that can be easily implemented in smart-contract layer, \r\n> (5) the willingness to implement ECIP 1043.\r\n\r\n> If the chain will split then I'll be here to support the pro-GPU version of the chain with my team and long-term roadmap.\r\n\r\nRegarding my personal involvement in the ECIP process and Discord since 8/28's meeting, I hope I have aggregated and documented enough of the vocal opposition to ECIP-1049 and ECIP-1095 that the SHA3-proponents change their narrative that \"there is no opposition to these proposals\" and stop misinforming the public that these proposals have garndered `Rough Consensus` and are on their way to `Accepted` status. It is irresponsible to the ECIP process and disengenous to the general public. These proposals are highly contentious and will certainly split the Ethereum Classic chain.\r\n\r\nThe Discord moderator @developerkevin has requested I relax on documenting the opposition to these proposals moving forward, and I feel I can oblige his request as I feel we are starting to get a seat at the table. I hope his employer ETC Coop (@bobsummerwill) and other proponents of `SHA3` like @p3c-bot  proceed through the ECIP process with a more geniune approach and represent this situation in an accurate light to the general public.\r\n\r\nThanks for participating in the ECIP process. Engagement is encouraged.",
