    "body": "Hi @Dexaran thank you for the explanation.\r\n\r\nNote there are two types of eclipse attack outlined in the paper:\r\n\r\n- Eclipse attack by monopolising connections\r\n- Eclipse attack by table poisoning\r\n\r\nYou say:\r\n\r\n> It is worth to mention that isolating a node is not an easy task already. We can't just tell a node \"Please drop your current connections and connect to mine nodes instead\".\r\n\r\nBut the latter method, table poisoning, appears to be exactly this.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the idea would not be to target a single node, but target groups of mining pools so you create a chain partition that lasts for 60+ blocks. If a node evetually then rejoins the network, they cannot reach consensus. \r\n\r\nI would also mention that a state actor, who controls a nations IP infrastructure (perhaps a nation state that controls the most mining power), would be able to trivially achieve this by blocking certain remote connections for a short amount of time (60 blocks).",
