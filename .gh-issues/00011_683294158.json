    "body": "From December 2020 it is possible to increase the hashrate for 100 TH/s which comes from the 4 GB cards that are currently mining ETH. By preventing further size increase of the DAG file and keeping the Ethash algorithm, ETC has a fantastic opportunity to have good features from BTC and ETH at the same time. In that case, it would resemble BTC in its decentralization and consistency, while it would have the advantages of programmability as ETH.",
