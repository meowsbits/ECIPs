    "body": "> ETC is Ethereum Classic, forked from original ETH. It uses EThash with a DAG file. The DAG file size is within 2 months of reaching 4 GB. At that size a lot of GPU's and ASICs will be obsolete.\r\n> \r\n> A 51% attack is less likely to happen when it is expensive. We are so close to make the cost more expensive and you want to throw that advantage away? It doesn't make sense at all.\r\n> \r\n> Better let it be for the moment and let's see what happens after all 4 GB GPUs and ASICs become obsolete for ETC. This will happen before they become obsolete for ETH, so you can see what will happen to ETC hashrate and ETH hashrate and the consequences for difficulty, price and miners reaction, how traders react to the new conditions and so on.\r\n\r\nEthash was designed with the intention of swaying the network to Proof of Stake. If ETC identifies as a PoW algorithm, then having a full PoW such as its native Keccak-256 solidifies that design and vision. Dagger, Hashimoto, and the Ice Age were all designed for the PoS agenda which is definitely not full PoW friendly.",
