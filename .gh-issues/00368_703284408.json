    "body": "Dropping here my last thoughts about this - and will shut up after ;) Had it posted originally in discord group, but want to have it documented here as well:\r\n\r\nI believe in the end ECIP 1099 will not resolve the \"attack-able\" over Nicehash issue. For the following reason:\r\nBack in summer 2018 we had the same issues (a bigger network with same PoW, Nicehash and 51% attacks on the smaller caps) on many Equihash coins (BTG, ZEL and so on, just to name a few) that had same pow as ZCash.\r\nThey kind of all decided to move to an other Equihash variant (144/5) and all use a different personalization string that makes to pow individual for each coin.\r\n\r\nBut: after a while Nicehash introduced this string as additional stratum parameter. So mining software understanding it were able to switch between the coins even without reconnecting. And to be serious: there is so much hr going over Nicehash that neither pools nor miner devs can allow themselves really  to ignore their proposed changes.\r\n\r\nSo history might repeat here: the moment they decide to send out that one bit info - to use eth or etc ecip 1099 seeding scheme - miner softwares will be able to switch again just while running. And every 8G card that then can mine eth can also do etc. So from that moment on the protection will be same as now without the ECIP.\r\n\r\nSo well ... not actually a concern about the ECIP - but rather rebutting the argument why this change might help at all.",
