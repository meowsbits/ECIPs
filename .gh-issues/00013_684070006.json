    "body": "After thinking about this proposal today and communicating with a few of the partispants behind this idea:\r\n\r\nThis proposal is currently in `Last Call` status and I think the vocal opposition in #mining should make an effort to get it pushed to `Rejected` status or to `Draft` due to all the uncertainites and security risks with this proposal.\r\n\r\n`Last Call` - An ECIP that is done with its initial iteration and ready for review by a wider audience.\r\nsource: https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs\r\n\r\nThe proposal is simply not ready for serious discussion and should not have been pushed through on the 8/28 call. The acceptence of ECIP-1049 with so many unanswered questions feels like a knee jerk reaction to the 51% attack the network experienced this month. It has been publicly noted that this proposal is underfunded by ETC Coop and likely needs more time to materialize into a polished proposal that the network can lean all of its $1B value on.\r\n\r\nWhere as ECIP-1043 is a far more practical approach to capturing friendly hashrate on Ethash and helping the network in that regard. This ECIP-1049 proposal shuffles risk from 51% attack Nicehash rental market to a laundry list of attack vectors and long term network security risks.\r\n\r\nI would personally champion this to be moved to `Draft` status and I beleive the idea is incomplete due to a lack of technical funding. I don't believe there is sufficient information on the supply chain of the equipment, the development resource commitment, and the proof that this proposal accomplishes the goal of making Ethereum Classic a more secure PoW network in the long-term.",
