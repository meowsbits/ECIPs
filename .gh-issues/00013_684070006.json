    "body": "After thinking about this proposal today and communicating with a few of the participants behind this idea:\r\n\r\nThis proposal is currently in `Last Call` status and I think the vocal opposition in #mining should make an effort to get it pushed to `Rejected` status due to the centralization concern or to `Draft` due to all the technical uncertainites and security risks with this proposal.\r\n\r\nLet's review these status and what they mean:\r\n`Last Call` - An ECIP that is done with its initial iteration and ready for review by a wider audience.\r\n`Rejected` - Reasons for rejecting ECIPs include duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, unfocused or too broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation, or obvious popular disapproval.\r\n`Draft` - An ECIP that is still undergoing iteration and changes, but is ready for general review. Make sure to remove [WIP] from the title so those who have muted the ECIP get the new status and can participate.\r\nsource: https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs\r\n\r\n`Draft` justification: IMO from talks with the author, the proposal is simply not ready for serious discussion and should not have been pushed through on the 8/28 call. The acceptence of ECIP-1049 with so many unanswered questions feels like a knee jerk reaction to the 51% attack the network experienced this month. It has been publicly noted that this proposal is underfunded by ETC Coop and likely needs more time to materialize into a polished proposal that the network can lean all of its $1B value on. I beleive the idea is incomplete due to a lack of technical funding and not on the personal fault of the author. This is a BIG ask in a proposal with a lot of moving parts to it. At this time as it sits in `Last Call` status, I don't believe there is sufficient information on the supply chain of the equipment, the development resource commitment, and the proof that this proposal accomplishes the goal of making Ethereum Classic a more secure PoW network in the long-term.\r\n\r\n`Rejected` justification: IMO this whole proposal violates the ETC Manifesto by leaning this $1B network on the shoulders of a small, unknown, and CENTRALIZED supply chain. This puts the entire network's security in the hands of a very small group. This also puts all of the network's future inflation in that small groups hands. This is fundamentally against the spirit of this network and violates the principles that unites us in so many ways. Lastly, this proposal will surely result in a contenious fork as the opposition to this proposal is growing more vocal by the day. The ECIP-1000 specifically cites that proposal should not aim to divide the community in this way.\r\n\r\nOpposition is real and material in size. Big contributors to small. Diversified throughout the ecosystem.:\r\nThe opposition to this proposal is not just the \"selfish, disenfranchised GPU mining participants\" as the pro-SHA3 body is trying to portray, there are participants from every facet of the ecosystem on the opposition side as you can read in this thread alone. If the decentralized opposition can materialize in a efficient way, there should be no doubt that this proposal does NOT have rough consensus in the ETC community due to these fundamental violations of the network's desire to be decentralized. I will stand firm as a vocal opponent to this proposal. Please ping me whenever the opposition needs a voice present as they are decentralized, many are non-native english speakers, unfamiliar/intimidated with the development process, and lack the ability to easily organize like the centralized parties pushing this proposal through the ECIP process via backdoor chatrooms, friendship requests, and DMs.\r\n\r\nConstructive Alternative Proposal:\r\nWhere as ECIP-1043 is a far more practical approach to capturing friendly hashrate on Ethash and helping the network in that regard. This ECIP-1049 proposal shuffles risk from 51% attack Nicehash rental market to a laundry list of attack vectors and long term network security risks.",
