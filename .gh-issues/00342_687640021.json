It is just a delayment of the problem and a \"theoretical hope that in a new environment things will be different\" without any actual difference on tech level.\r\n\r\nSecond, this is in no way \"the only solution\" because [ECIP 1092](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/327) and [ECIP 1095](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/348) propose another options that can **effectively solve the problem at protocol level**. There is [the live evidence](https://whattomine.com/coins/283-clo-ethash) that ECIP 1092 can definitely solve the problem of 51% attacks for Ethash chains.\r\n\r\n>Whether miners come or not is dependent on the payment per block and the certainty they assess that they will actually get that payment as opposed to being reorg'd all the time as it's happening now.\r\n\r\nMiners are dependant on hardware. In case there is no suitable hardware ready for deployment the \"establishment phase\" right after the algo switch is even more dangerous than being a minority chain. It renders the chain vulnerable so that a malicious actor can invest a relatively small quantity of funds to disrupt and destroy the network completely.\r\n\r\n>A change to sha3 is not a \"reset of the ecosystem\", it's only a legitimate mining algorithm change given the obvious vulnerability and real life attacks ETC is suffering.\r\n\r\nI completely disagree.\r\n\r\nSha3 is an ASIC-friendly algorithm and ASIC mining is more centralized than GPU mining. This goes directly against the core principles of the network.\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/@bit_novosti/a-crypto-decentralist-manifesto-6ba1fa0b9ede",
