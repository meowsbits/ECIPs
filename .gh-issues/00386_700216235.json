    "body": "@q9f so what you are describing is also a sort of programme:\r\n\r\n1. Now: implement ECIP-1099 + MESS\r\n2. In nine months: implement ECIP-1049 + delete ETCash (1099) and delete MESS\r\n\r\nI see the \"training wheels\" purpose as current hash power is so low that it doesn't make ETC stable anyway. But,\r\n\r\n- why is ECIP-1099 ready to go and ECIP-1049 not? Isn't 1099 equally untested and immature?\r\n- how can it be guaranteed that MESS is deleted? isn't it better to implement it with a termination date?",
