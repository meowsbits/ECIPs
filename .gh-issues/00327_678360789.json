    "body": ">Github is the most proper platform to discuss technical merits of the proposals without any third-party moderation and other teams controlling the time allocation etc.\r\n\r\nFair enough, you're right about the Q&A between teams. It was one of my `suggestions` after the backlash from the call for those that `desired` talking during that call but didn't get the opportunity. I can see how one would prefer Github if they don't want to utilize those calls. And I feel you're correct that Github is the proper channel since that is what the ECIP proces states. Of course, you shouldn't be `required` to do anything outside of the ECIP process. I don't think anyone was `requiring` this suggestion, it was more of an invitiation to join that form of dialogue.\r\n\r\nIMO some of your criticism has merit, other parts are hyperbolic. As an example, I submitted an ECIP the same day as you, ECIP 1093, and it's been treated similar; no tweets, broken file path, auto rejection in a poorly handled CDC call.\r\n\r\nHowever, your ECIP got a `marketing push from ETC Labs` this past week via crypto publication articles. Additionally the `#general` channel has been flooded with new accounts shilling of your proposal for nearly two weeks. You've had community members engaging in thoughtful discussion related to the technical merits of the proposal. So it's not as if it has not gotten attention. Just some food for thought as you complain about a lack of attention.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I drafted up this little blog to try to keep track of all the evolving proposals and topics buzzing around the ECIP world:\r\nhttps://ethereumclassic.org/blog/2020-08-21-core-devs-call-2020-Q3-Hardfork-Process-Feedback\r\n",
