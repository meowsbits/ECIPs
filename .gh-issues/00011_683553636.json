    "body": "I think the goal should be to make the transition as smoothly as possible. Going back to a ~1.5 GB DAG wouldn't be of much benefit for anyone mining ETC today. If someone is sitting on a pile of old 2 or 3 GB cards, maybe, but then then profitability of mining with such old hardware should be considered - eventually, the electricity bill will get you, no matter how small the DAG is.\r\n\r\nAs I understand Cody's proposal, the DAG content would still change, just the size would be much smaller than today. A ROM DAG would indeed open new possibilities that may lead to ASIC dominance (i.e., the abrupt obsoleting of GPUs, similar to what happened on BTC or, more recently, I've been told, RVN.) I'm aware that the SHA3 proponents actively embrace ASIC dominance, but their plan is more long-termish, and may very well suffer delays.\r\n\r\nAlso, a major divergence from today's situation may enable different approaches, like on-the-fly DAG calculation, which would produce similarly undesirable results.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to choose a) a transition point T, and b) a fixed target epoch F, with F <= T but without a big difference between the two. F should be chosen such that the majority of 4 GB miners will still be happy with it. This would ensure that present-day miners would not suffer any upset and it would avoid the potential issues mentioned above.\r\n\r\nAllowing for F < T would also mitigate the risk of miners crossing their hardware's 4 GB barrier before reaching T. They'd still be temporarily excluded from mining ETC, but they'd have the assurance that they'll be able to return before too long.\r\n\r\nWe could simply pick a tentative value for F in the near future, without having to have all the rest ready. If there's no large outcry from 4 GB miners in the week after reaching that epoch, we'll know the choice has been safe. If there's an outcry, we fix it :)\r\n\r\nI would advise against continued DAG growth, even if reduced. That just adds complexity, and given the undesirability of F << T, it might still be a risk for 4 GB miners.",
