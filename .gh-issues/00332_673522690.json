    "body": "In review of the document at [A Proposal for An Ethereum Classic Treasury System](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/a-proposal-for-an-ethereum-classic-treasury-system/) (PDF [here](https://api.zotero.org/groups/478201/items/SGNSSMX2/file/view?key=Qcjdk4erSuUZ8jvAah59Asef))...\r\n\r\n- _Voters_ are defined as \"stakers\" willing to freeze >=500 ETC (S2.4.1) as collateral against the right to vote, and are incentivized to do so with a \"voter reward\" calculated at the end of the epoch. A voter is allowed to cast a vote in the opinions of Accept, Abstain, or Reject. This means that all stakeholders who are willing to hold assets for or beyond each `3*epoch`  are incentivized to participate _at least_ in opinion-abstinence (Abstain). So stakeholders can garner rewards (proportional to their stake) without actually contributing to the democratic process (neither For nor Against proposals). This seems like a significant inefficiency, suggesting perhaps that the Treasury as proposed is in effect a bank, whose interest rates are a.) funded by the Miners, b.) access-controlled by miners (availability), and c.) proportional to capital stake. Removing the _Abstain_ vote would promote no-op or malicious proposals, or? See also S4.5.\r\n\r\n- Since _Voter Reward_ is a function of _Voter Participation_ (whether via an on-chain smart contract or \"special\" new transaction types), could this imply an incentive for an miner(s) to censor voter participation by excluding voting transactions (except for their own, of course) from blocks? Unfortunately, I don't see this type of DoS attack this covered in S5.2. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure I see an alignment of the interests (and necessary mechanisms) of democracy and the interests of stakeholder rewards. And if they are not aligned, then what keeps miners from staking only their own votes to garner disproportional and undemocratic marginal rewards on their own stake?... \"indirect\" supposed externalities, like the price of ETC falling because the Treasury wasn't working?\r\n\r\nHave I got something wrong here?",
