    "body": "Sadly, there is still no formal definition of the change. Such a definition should include, as a minimum,\r\n- the representation of the chain this modification is applied to,\r\n- the ways how this chain is updated,\r\n- precisely where, when, and how Pirlguard modifies the update process and with which points of the chain representation it interacts, all this described in the terms defined as part of this formal definition,\r\n- if not part of the above item, actions that result from Pirlguard's classification.\r\nOnly then will it be possible to meaningfully reason about the effectiveness of the protection afforded by Pirlguard, possible weaknesses, and to analyze/simulate effects emerging from the interaction of groups of nodes.\r\nFor a change to a consensus protocol, this amount of formal foundation should be considered a minimum requirement before it could move beyond any draft stage of a standardization process. Having an implementation is nice, but introduces a vast number of details that probably are not relevant to the intended design of Pirlguard.",
