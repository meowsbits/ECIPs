    "body": "This discussion is in regards to 1099, only. 1049 and 1100, have their own discussion threads. 1099 is not trying to address the attacks (nor is 1049 for that mater), as outlined in the proposal, it's intent is to reduce the DAG size and future growth to better support GPUs in use by existing miners today.\r\n\r\nIn regards to ETH miners attacking ETC once (read if) ETH2 finally launches, this makes little sense, it would be one of the more profitable chains to mine with GPUs, attacking would be akin to shooting oneself in the foot. Attacks have been coming from rentals, they have not been coming from miners that have invested long term in their own hardware. Even if this is a concern, the only mitigation would be to dilute the attackers hashrate, with more hash, from more GPUs.. \r\n\r\n",
