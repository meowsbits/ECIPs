    "body": "I see your points, but then, left aside my particular high-costs energy position, I think there is much more to say, starting from MESS and ending with keccak256: one can't talk against DAG size reduction without adding the two above as a whole, and this is why ECIPs 1099 and 1100 are there together.\r\n\r\nETC needs a boost, but it's not just a security matter: it's an empaty matter, like said.\r\n\r\nLet's say ETC rejects DAG reduction: so, ETC will be left with MESS and keccak256 to solve the 51% attacks issue for at least 2 years. Meanwhile, I'd like to know from where a significant hashing power boost is supposed to come from to ETC, given that to see the 1st keccak ASICS we'll have to wait a bit and that, being ETH POW still there, people will wait before switching.\r\n\r\nThere are 20 Ths waiting a TRUE target to mine (alternatives are not qualified), but they won't wait long: people have started already trying to switch to 6-8 gb cards,  (hardware prices show it clearly), and actually I can't see valid reasons why the same percentages showed by HiveOs won't be valid for the short-mid term to those \"switchers\". This is an empaty matter.\r\n\r\nMESS and Kecaak256 are the answer to the 51% issue. This is a security matter.\r\n\r\nAll trading platforms, as we all know, have already applied large delays to ETC, and this goes to security.\r\n\r\nNow it's time to empaty.",
