    "body": "It seems like ETC would be missing out on all the GPU miners looking for a home after ETH moves to PoS. If ECIP-1043 is implemented then this resource becomes even bigger/more distributed. \r\n\r\nMoving to a more ASIC-friendly algoritm seems to be a knee-jerk reaction to the recent 51% attacks and will cost decentralisation. As [previously raised](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/342#issuecomment-685322135), 100% attacks are theroetically possible if control of PoW is left in the hands of ASIC manufacturers.",
