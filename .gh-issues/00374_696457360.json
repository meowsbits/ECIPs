    "body": "Satoshi:\r\n\r\n\"It is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered the valid one. Nodes that were present may remember that one branch was there first and got replaced by another, but there would be no way for them to convince those who were not present of this. We can't have subfactions of nodes that cling to one branch that they think was first, others that saw another branch first, and others that joined later and never saw what happened. The CPU power proof-of-work vote must have the final say. The only way for everyone to stay on the same page is to believe that the longest chain is always the valid one, no matter what.\"\r\n\r\nCody:\r\n\r\n\"Maybe there is a need for an overarching 'core principle / best practice' : 'small reorgs are normal and healthy, large reorgs are suspicious. given a reorg of unusual length; nodes should evaluate the current chain head they have with preference over the incoming chain with longer length or higher difficulty' This would cover PG, MESS, and possibly checkpointing.\"\r\n\r\nVitalik:\r\n\r\n\"However, new nodes joining the network, and nodes that appear online after a very long time, would not have the consensus algorithm reliably protecting them. Fortunately, for them, the solution is simple: the first time they sign up, and every time they stay offline for a very very long time, they need only get a recent block hash from a friend, a blockchain explorer, or simply their software provider, and paste it into their blockchain client as a “checkpoint”. They will then be able to securely update their view of the current state from there.\"\r\n\r\nIsaac, James, and Terry:\r\n\r\n\"What Cody Burns and Vitalik say.\"\r\n\r\nFabio and the rest of Ethereum Classic NPCs:\r\n\r\n\"I just want number go up....yay!\"\r\n\r\nCommon Sense:\r\n\r\n ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ ",
