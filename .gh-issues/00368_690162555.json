    "body": "Thanks for proposing this. My first thoughts:\r\n\r\nPro: \r\n* :+1: it's a good temporary 51% attack solution as it modifies ethash enough to invalidate hashrate available on nicehash et al.\r\n* :+1: we kind of missed the activation window for ECIP-1043 DAG size limitation (epoch < 350), this is a viable solution even right now or in 2-3 months\r\n* :+1: this will not only maintain long-term compatibility with current 4GB mining cards but also re-enable 2GB and 3GB GPU mining for a while\r\n\r\nCon:\r\n*  :warning: needs a hardfork\r\n*  :warning: needs custom miner software",
