    "body": "I think the essential problem, @realcodywburns, is that these public, well-known, hopefully fairly reliable testnets are used for both purposes.\r\n\r\nThere is a general expectation of decent availability for Mordor and Kotti, and there is an expectation of continuity.   If you have something deployed on these testnets and it gets nuked, that is really rather inconvenient.\r\n\r\nI think that perhaps what the universe is telling us is that we need more public networks than we have.\r\n\r\nThere is no need whatsoever for a long-running public testnet for transition testing.   I would propose that, like Nazgul, new ad-hoc, single-purpose testnets would better serve that need, and indeed Whiteblock Genesis might be a good host environment for such.\r\n\r\nThose would reboot on some fixed cadence - starting with the current protocol, and then upgrading at some fairly early block.   So we could dry-run the transition many, many times.",
