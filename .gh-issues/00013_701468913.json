    "body": "\r\n\r\n\r\n> > It proposes changing ethash (a complete consensus engine) for keccak-256, a hashing function, and does not at all go in to detail regarding the rest of the consensus engine. As is, blocktimes, monetary policy, hashing function(s), difficulty algo, ghost protocol/uncles, DAG/caches, block validation and sealing are all part of the ethash consensus engine. Disabling or removing ethash, disables/removes ALL of this.\r\n> \r\n> Nonsense! Replacing the PoW algorithm (as opposed to misleadingly suggesting its removal) in no way affects all these other buzz-words you throw in willy nilly.\r\n\r\ndifficulty algo: https://github.com/etclabscore/core-geth/blob/master/consensus/ethash/consensus.go#L308\r\nmonetary policy: https://github.com/etclabscore/core-geth/blob/master/consensus/ethash/consensus_classic.go#L27\r\n\r\nbuzzwords.....\r\n\r\nEDIT: whether this proposal introduces a new consensus engine (along side clique and ethash), or simply modifies the existing engine (ethash), is sorta crucial for implementation. No evm based chains have changed consensus engines mid chain. It's uncharted terroritory requiring massive refactoring of client software, as this behaviour was never intended. A very different scenario to modifying the existing ethash engine. ",
