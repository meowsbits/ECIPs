    "body": "@antsankov These unaddressed opposition comments date back to 2019. You've had ample time to address them in written form.\r\n\r\n> I had taken time to prepare extensively, brought experts on, and extensively addressed all concerns brought up during the call.\r\n\r\nIts great to hear you're prepared for CDC 15.\r\n\r\nTo be clear why this call is being held now: You submitted to `finalize` this proposal's draft only 5 days ago via the cited PR above (https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/379).\r\n\r\nLets keep it factual. All of us would prefer you engaged in the written outlets provided in GitHub so international members could participate in coverstion with you. However, you have repeatedly ignored those requests. And, have insisted the community hold a special CDC to communicate with you via voice. It's odd, but here we are honoring your special requests as the ECIP author of the proposal.\r\n\r\nPlease note oppositon in the formal GitHub threads is just as valid as vocal opposition on the CDC's. To date, this opposition has gone unacknowledged.\r\n\r\nAlso please note how much development focus and resources you've consumed toward your proposal. Six+ 51% attack proposals have been forced to take a back seat to your agenda to rush this through in the network's time of weakness.\r\n\r\nI look forward to October 2nd, as do many of the documented opposition since 2019; opposition that have been present since the date you originaly proposed this idea.\r\n\r\nThank you for finally agreeing to have the conversation and acknowledge the opposition to this proposal.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to prevent a chain split in the future.",
