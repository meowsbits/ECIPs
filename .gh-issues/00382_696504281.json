    "body": "@antsankov you've had these comments open since 2019. \"I had taken time to prepare extensively, brought experts on, and extensively addressed all concerns brought up during the call.\" Its great to hear you're prepared for CDC 15.\r\n\r\nTo be clear why this call is being held now: You submitted to finalized this proposal's draft 5 days ago via the cited PR above. Lets keep it factual. All of us would prefer you engaged in written outlets provided so international members could participate in coverstion with you. But you've decided to require a CDC to communicate with you via voice. It's odd, but here we are honoring your special requests that no other ECIP authors request. Please note oppositon in the formal GitHub threads is just as valid as vocal opposition on the CDC's.\r\n\r\nI look forward to October 2nd as do many of the documented opposition since 2019 when you originaly proposed this idea. Thanks for finally agreeing to have the conversation and acknowledge the opposition to this proposal.",
