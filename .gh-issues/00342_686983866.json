    "body": "I have a few questions for those who say changing ETC algo to SHA3 is the only or the best solution to prevent a 51% attack on the ETC network.\r\n\r\n1. Is SHA3 algo ETC planning to implement, same as the one used by the Smartcash and Max coin (Keccak)? if so,\r\n\r\n2. Will it be possible to dual mine it with Ethash using Claymore miner? \r\n\r\n3. If dual mine is possible, ETC will be the free cake for all ETH miner and All ETH miners will get the ETC almost for free. That will give negative implications on ETC's economic development (price growth) [It's human nature, we do not care for the things which we get for free]. What is the guarantee that those Ethash dual miners will not dump dual mined ETC right away?\r\n\r\n4. The question-3 also arises the further question about what if those Ethash dual miners will make extra hash power available on renting services. Sorry but Miningrigrentals already has +15 THs power available for rent (https://www.miningrigrentals.com/rigs/sha3).\r\n\r\n5. Few here mentioned that by implementing SHA3 we will be majority chain, How can you guarantee that? Maybe we will remain the majority chain for some time. What if some other popular project will implement SHA3! We all know Monero did think about switching to SHA3, though it did not go forward with that. What is the guarantee that they will not think again about switching to SHA3?",
