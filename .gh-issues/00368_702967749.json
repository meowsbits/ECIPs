    "body": "> > Well, Just few worlds. In Italy you pay 0,23â‚¬/kW. This Is the reasons why I had choosen RX 470 gpus (48w/26mh) @ Wall 8 x 470 + sys l+/- 500w x 200 mh. Eth Is going pos, 4 gb cards left with ravencoins. I understand all reasons above, but looking @ me this would be another chance.\r\n> \r\n> For me this is rather a reason not to do this change. I mean consider having 8G instead of 4G cards. How would you think then?\r\n> Also consider this: if ETC profitability is halving, would you still mine it in Italy? Or if only 1/4 is left would you still stay? Likely: no. But others with only 10ct or lesser (some countries have only 3ct energy cost and less) would say yes - in lack of other options they would continue, because its still profitable there while its not here.\r\n> \r\n> So what is going to happen: all the 4G miners with extra low energy cost will switch from eth to etc. Since eth network is so much larger this will dump the profitability and push out all miners from countries with higher energy cost ending up in a centralization of few huge mining operations with 4G farms in cheap power countries left. That might be happy - but loosing mining community of potential 8G miners everywhere else is worth it? I do not think so.\r\n\r\nWell you may be correct but imagine what will happen when all that 4G cards mine ravencoin or beam or something else its going to be even lower profitability. I'm in Canada I have 8 cents/kwh. Even if the 4G cards can mine the 8G cards will be faster and more efficient so even If you have 8G card you will be profitable, ravencoin is already 1/2 the profitability of ETC so I will keep mining.\r\n\r\nThe same issue with low electric cost is an issue even with 8G cards too.",
