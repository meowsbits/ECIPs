    "body": "Let me point out that the DAG size reduction will also restore original hashrate performance of some 8GB nVidia Pascal GPUs affected by insufficient TLB design. This consists in up to a 27% hr boost for them.\r\n\r\nI don't know how many of the active 8GB miners are currently running on those GPUs, but I'd like to make some considerations about them:\r\n- the DAG size reduction would protect their planned investments\r\n- the hashpower they're currently providing to Ethash pools depends on the coin they mine, this means the above mentioned hr boost will affect both their current ETC hashpower and any they would move to ETC from ETH",
