    "body": "> @q9f i'm reading the discussion in #general occurring right now. Since we are hold a 9/11 call. Should we prioritize the 51% solutions to get them moving through the process? I am having a hard time mentally justifying prioritizing ECIP-1049 (a one year plus roll out) over the 51% attack solutions that address the immediate threat to the network:\r\n> \r\n> So high priority ECIPs:\r\n> ECIP-1043 #11\r\n> ECIP-1092 #327\r\n> ECIP-1097 #348\r\n> \r\n> Once these three ECIPs are in motion we have ALL year to discuss moving the network to SHA3, as the network will then be out of the current fire.\r\n> \r\n> Do any of the current ECIP participants feel that the priority should be on these three 51% attack ECIPs right now and we shouldn't be rushing a miner algorithm change before addressing these solutions and stabilizing the network?\r\n> \r\n> Maybe my logic is flawed regarding this issue. Feel free to explain why.\r\n\r\nThe priority is the \"51% attack protection\", in which the ECIP-1043 #11 is the most favorite at the moment (there are no objections till now).\r\n\r\nBut sure, there should be no rush. The proposal championings and discussions can run parallel, if the capacity of the developers/network participants allow it.",
