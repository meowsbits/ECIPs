    "body": "I think that we would need another Core Developers call if we wanted to reintroduce 1884, because that is a substantial change in plan.   We very intentionally rejected it in November.\r\n\r\nI understand that it would be simple to include 1884, but I think it would also be ideologically weak and I don't think it is necessary.\r\n\r\nAll the pain is coming from 2200 and if we just stick with existing consensus then all that pain goes away too.\r\n",
