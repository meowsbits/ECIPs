    "body": "Thank you for adjusting the time away from 9/11. I will be available for the September 25th meeting. @q9f I appreciate you.\r\n\r\nLast CDC CDC Results on 8/28: https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/362\r\n\r\nMy vote for the agenda is to narrow in on the proposed 51% attack solutions with motions for the following:\r\n- ECIP-1043 Review Ends September 18, 2020 https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/11\r\n- ECIP-1092 motion to move to `Last Call` or `Rejected` status for deeper techincal review from `Draft` status https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/348\r\n- ECIP-1097 motion to move to `Last Call` or `Rejected` status for deeper technical review from `Draft` status https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/327\r\n\r\nAnd no other topics to prevent distracting from the issue at hand.\r\n\r\n@antsankov or @pc3_bot, please keep the personal attack to the discord server. This is for professional conversations. Thank you. There are plenty of criticisms to your proposal that need to be addrssed before you're ready from a proper CDC meeting. But I look forward to attending that.\r\n\r\nAs you have mentioned personally and I share the sentiment, we have more important topics to discuss than your proposal; the 51% attack solutions are the most important topic. Let's keep our focus there and we can schedule review of your ECIP-1049 SHA3 proposal at 6 weeks mark of `Last Call` status like was recommended in the 8/28 meeting (October 2nd). https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/333#issuecomment-682969865\r\n\r\nThank you for clarifying why this meeting's date was being rushed (https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/333#issuecomment-682969865) by pro-SHA3 participants due to their proposal timeline goals, but I don't think ECIP-1049 is more important than addressing the 51% attack solutions with our limited time on this call.\r\n\r\nFor the record, your ECIP was not present on the agenda when I recommended we don't hold the meeting on 9/11. The meeting's agenda was blank with \"To Be Determined\". There was no correlation to my recommendation that we move away from the 9/11 date and my opposition to your proposal. This is paranoia of a strong and vocal opposition to your proposal. Let's save that for October 9th as laid out in the 8/28 CDC. https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/333#issuecomment-682969865\r\n\r\n> SonnyRollinsToday at x:32 PM\r\n> The sooner we can move past the 51% attacks specifically the better off weâ€™re going to be.\r\n\r\nThank you for your passion to ETC and thank you for contributing to the ECIP process. We can disagree, but be agreeable. We both want whats best for the network or we wouldn't be here. Stay blessed.",
