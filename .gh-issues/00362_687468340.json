    "body": "Thank you for adjusting the time away from 9/11. I will be available for the September 25th meeting. @q9f I appreciate you.\r\n\r\nMy vote for the agena is to narrow in on the proposed 51% attack solutions with motions for the following:\r\n- ECIP-1043 move to `Accepted` status out of `Last Call`\r\n- ECIP-1097 move to `Last Call` status for deeper technical review from `Draft` status\r\n- ECIP-1092 move to `Last Call` status for deeper techincal review from `Draft` staus\r\n\r\nAnd no other topics to prevent distracting from the issue at hand.\r\n\r\n@antsankov or @pc3_bot, please keep te personal attack to the discord server. This is for professional conversations. Thank you. There are plenty of criticisms to your proposal that need to be addrssed before you're ready from a proper CDC meeting. But i look forward to attending that. As you have mentioned personally and I share the sentiment, we have more important topics to discuss than your proposal; the 51% attack solutions. let's keep our focus there and we can schedule review of your proposal at 6 weeks mark of `Last Call` status like was recommended in the 8/28 meeting. Thank you for your passion to ETC and thank you for contributing to the ECIP process.",
