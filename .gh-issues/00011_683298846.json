By preventing further size increase of the DAG file and keeping the Ethash algorithm, ETC has a fantastic opportunity to have good features from BTC and ETH at the same time. In that case, it would resemble BTC in its decentralization and consistency, while it would have the advantages of programmability as ETH.\n\n—\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/11#issuecomment-683294158>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AISARWYC7ZKU2ODVF5KT2GLSDECTLANCNFSM4GP7ADYA>.\n",
