    "body": "Questions from the review:\r\n\r\n* Why SHA3 instead of Keccak256? Keccak256 is already part of the client and ECIP-1049 would be much simpler to execute. ECIP-1095 would require clients to implement both SHA3 and Keccak256 which might lead to confusion.\r\n* How would a transition to SHA3 look like? Having a hardfork block is not sufficient to securely swap out the consensus.",
