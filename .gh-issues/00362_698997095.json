    "body": "ECIP 1096 :\r\n1. does it require a hardfork? (backwards-compatibility)\r\nYes, to get 100% of the protections the system provides.\r\n\r\n2. does it break nakamoto consensus? (one cpu, one vote)\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n3. is there a specification for ethereum classic available? (some proposals come from other ecosystems)\r\nThe ECIP provides guidance on implementation, but it's not 100% complete. We could finish it in a short time if the ETC community is really interested in moving forward.\r\n\r\n4. is there a transition for activation specified? (does it need one? activation block? smooth transtion?)\r\nWe haven't yet specified. It can be smooth or drastic. The proposal enables the level protection to be gradually incremented.\r\n\r\n5. is there any implementation or simulation available? (python, go, crystal, c++, rust, ...)\r\nare test cases available that can be used by the client teams?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nI would also like to mention that ECIP 1096 provides some key benefits, such being a decentralized solution.\r\nAnd it could also allow to build pre-compiles in ETC to access the Bitcoin headers for further interoperability, as the Bitcoin headers will be attached to ETC headers in an censor-resistant way.\r\n  ",
