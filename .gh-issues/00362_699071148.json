    "body": "Thanks everyone. Kevin has a recording.\r\n\r\nHere are my rough notes:\r\n\r\n* ECIP 1049 was skipped, **remains in \"last call\"** for another two weeks, please join the breakout call next week to further discuss keccak mining algorithm, see #382 \r\n* **ECIP 1099 remains in \"last call\"** but new block numbers (pushed back to allow besu to implement it), this will move to \"accepted\" next friday unless you raise your concerns, core developers start working on implementations and preparing releases, see #371\r\n* **ECBP 1100** was demonstrated on the \"messnet\" testnet, it **moves to \"active\"** with a mordor block number for testing, mainnet decision depends on testnet progress, no mainnet block number yet\r\n* ECIP 1092 was skipped, nobody spoke in favor of it\r\n* ECIP 1094 was skipped, there will be a presentation by max next week\r\n* ECIP 1096 was discussed\r\n* ECIP 1097 was discussed, requires either a hardfork or optinally a soft fork, we would have to chose trusted parties for committee\r\n\r\nImportant items are **bold**.",
