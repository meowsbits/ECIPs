We would defer the ones about ECIP process itself to another call.   We aren't going to have time for that, but we might have time to do the \"paperwork\" on the others.\r\n\r\n- [ECIP-0001: Process ECIP-0001, Replacement of ECIP-1000](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/277)\r\n- [ECIP-1077: Meta Specification Establishing Fork ECIPs (Using Pull Request development pattern)](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/224)\r\n- [ECIP-1000: propose only one meta ecip per hard fork] (https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/221) .
