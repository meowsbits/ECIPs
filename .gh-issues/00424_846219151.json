    "body": "Hey going forward I think we need more transparency around these meetings. It‚Äôs not like these are just ‚Äúafternoon tea‚Äù calls. I understand that you @q9f organized this well in advance, but I think it‚Äôs important we give all contributors the opportunity to be present. \r\n\r\nEthereum ACD meetings are good examples of how such calls are handled. I am more than willing to facilitate and record the meetings as well as take down and publish any notes, and recordings, and set up possibly live streams. \r\n\r\nAnybody not in the ETC GitHub were likely unaware about today‚Äôs meeting and did not attend. If at all a possible please ping me or let me know @q9f. ‚úåüèº",
