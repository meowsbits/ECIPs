    "body": "I'm referring to implementation, which happens to be key here, given a hard fork is required, and in which the proposal is lacking in much information in terms of the changeover. \r\n\r\n* Activation Block: 12,000,000 (approx. 4 months from acceptance - January 2021)\r\n* If not activated by Block 12,500,000 this ECIP is voided and moved to Rejected.\r\n* We recommend difficulty be multiplied 100 times at the first Keccak-256 block compared to the final Ethash block. This is to compensate for the higher performance of Keccak and to prevent a pileup of orphaned blocks at switchover. This is not required for launch.\r\n\r\nA consensus breaking change such as multiplying the difficulty by 100x, can not be a recommendation, is it part of the specification or not? \r\n\r\nGiven the scope of the change (requires hard fork) I would like to see more information on how the specification is intended to be implemented on a live network that currently uses ethash as the consensus engine. The only reference client provided, doesnt handle a changeover, and is based on a client that no longer supports the network. https://github.com/antsankov/parity-ethereum/blob/sha3/astor.json#L5 This would imply we are simply modifying the ethash engine, yet language like \"the final Ethash block\" would imply it's being replaced. \r\n\r\nI, as a client dev, am seeking clarity as the proposal, as is, leaves me with questions on the intended implementation.\r\n",
