    "body": "@hitchcott  answering your questions:\r\n\r\n>I wanted to raise another potential issue with the PirlGuard appraoch, and open up discusson on how the network would handle eclipse attacks\r\n\r\nThis is not an issue of PirlGuard in first place. Then \"isolating a node with PirlGuard\" is as hard as \"isolating a node without PirlGuard\". So the complexity of the attack is literally the same.\r\n\r\n>As far as I understand, with PirlGuard, an eclipse attack (or an eclipse attack + 40% attack) would do extra damage to the network compared to not having PirlGuard in place.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell. The PirlGuard will make mitigating the consequences of an attack harder for those who rely on a single node because a single node would not be capable of determining whether it is on the correct chain or not in case of a succesful attack.\r\n\r\nHowever, the owner of this node will be able to make a decision objectively and deterministically. It is always known which chain should be the correct chain post-factum. So it is only necessary to halt operating during the attack and help the affected nodes to resync after the attacker runs our of funds.\r\n\r\nIn the current state of the network the main problem is that it is not even possible to determine whether there is an attack or not thus blockchain entities can not halt their operation or perform any investigation at the time before the get damaged.\r\n\r\n>My impression is that the subjective finality that is added with PirlGuard would, in the case of a long network partition (either by natural disasters or an eclipse attack), permenantly split or fragment the network (because of the reorg cap).\r\n\r\nFinality is not subjective. It is simply governed by new consensus rules, which are certainly objective, but to some extent dependent on the previous state of the network. Unlike the current consensus rules that assume that the network could be shut down and then resumed at any time. However in reality the network is never shut down and we can remove these redundant mechanics from the consensus.\r\n\r\nNaturally long partitions never happen. You can point me out any example since 2009 if you have any. I'm not aware of any natural chain splits for the past 11 years. Prevention of such chain splits is the main goal of the network and all the complex underlying mechanics because this splits would make the network unusable.\r\n\r\nIn case of a successful eclipse attack a node or a group of nodes may be definitely isolated and it will never sync with the mainnet chain again. However this would not happen if some of this nodes have a whitelisted private connection with another distanced node to compare with.\r\n\r\n>This type of attack wouldn't necessarily be about trying to profit from a double spend, but instead trying to create havok, perhaps in the hopes of manipulating the price of ETC with leveraged short positions, or simply for ideological reasons without a profit motive.\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the attack is not known and taking control over the 100% of the nodes of the network is not possible even in theory then the attack has little to no chance of success.\r\n\r\nBy implementing ECIP 1092 we are trading **\"Invest `$X` of funds to have a 100% guarantee to harm the network and make $2X as profit\"** for **\"Sacrifice some unknown amount of funds that is more than `$X` to have an unknown chance of harming the network. May be. If all the network participants don't care about their security at all and don't even want to run a couple of background nodes to secure their funds.\"**\r\n\r\n>For this reason I dont think that the chains that already use PirlGuard (with smaller market caps and less ideological beef) prove that this kind of attack isn't plausable, as the economics and politics are different.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe economics and ideological background of 51%-attacks are absolutely the same from what we can observe in the past history of out projects. These are the same at the present. \r\n\r\nThere is no reason to assume that economics and politics are different in case of this attack.\r\n",
