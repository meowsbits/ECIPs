    "body": "> @q9f i'm reading the discussion in #general occurring right now. Since we are hold a 9/11 call. Should we prioritize the 51% solutions to get them moving through the process? I am having a hard time mentally justifying prioritizing ECIP-1049 (a one year plus roll out) over the 51% attack solutions that address the immediate threat to the network:\r\n> \r\n> So high priority ECIPs:\r\n> ECIP-1043 #11\r\n> ECIP-1092 #327\r\n> ECIP-1097 #348\r\n> \r\n> Once these three ECIPs are in motion we have ALL year to discuss moving the network to SHA3, as the network will then be out of the current fire.\r\n> \r\n> Do any of the current ECIP participants feel that the priority should be on these three 51% attack ECIPs right now and we shouldn't be rushing a miner algorithm change before addressing these solutions and stabilizing the network?\r\n> \r\n> Maybe my logic is flawed regarding this issue. Feel free to explain why.\r\n\r\nAfter listening to the end of the [CDC 13](https://youtu.be/9r_q_z81eh4?t=3422). It is disheartening to hear that developers haven't had the time to even review ECIP-1092 at this point due to the `mining algo change` narrative being pushed ahead of legitmate 51% attack solutions. I ask the ECIP participants to stay focused on the `high priority` solutions like my previous messages have been suggesting. We don't have the bandwidth to be fighting about a mining algo change right now. 51% attack solutions should be on the forefront of our efforts.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of prioritizing `51% Attack Solutions` over all else, I have requested to move ECIP-1093 to `Withdrawn` status. https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/376",
