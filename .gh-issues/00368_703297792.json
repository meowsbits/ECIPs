From the ETC Core Devs Call 14 on 25th of September:\r\n> \r\n> * ECIP 1099 remains in \"last call\" but new block numbers (pushed back to allow besu to implement it), this will move to \"accepted\" next friday (2nd of October) unless you raise your concerns, core developers start working on implementations and preparing releases, see also the #376. The activation is on the block height 11_700_000.\r\n> \r\n> Since today this proposal should be moved to \"accepted\" state. Awaiting for ECIP-Editors :-)\r\n\r\nThanks guys I'm exited to see this !",
