    "body": "> This prevents the EIP2200 fix (EIP2200.constantGas=800, eg. etclabscore/multi-geth#144) from breaking the testnets by changing (actually correcting) the gas price without doing so in a hard fork. (Kind of a weird concept: the correction would break the incorrect network implementations; this proposal effectively delays the correction indefinitely on these affected networks).\r\n\r\nExactly. Fun fact, such a thing used to happen on Ethereum Foundation mainnet and it was decided to rather specify the bug than rolling back the network.",
