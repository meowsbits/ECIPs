    "body": "Well, thanks for the honest feedback, I try to make _less disaster_ next time.\r\n\r\nCharles was attacking me for kindly cutting him off because he tried to hijack the call for his own agenda. I just defended the process and got the beating for it. It's easy to play down my role here, but in fact I defended the publicly crowdsourced agenda.\r\n\r\nIf you do believe there is an improvement to be made, please go ahead and help iterating the process. Blaming each other does not help Ethereum Classic at all. And I'm not doing this for myself, I'm doing this for Ethereum Classic.",
