    "body": "The boss in the system is the database. This means no one can hold any veto or reserve any special powers. Therefore, giving miners the ability to veto decisions creates an imbalance in the improvement proposal process.\r\n\r\nThe treasury is already an imbalance as it gives power to the few dev teams and super-voters to decide the future of the database which contains the decentralized programs, money, property, and agreements, which are the \"sacred cow\" of the system.\r\n\r\nAdding an additional level of complexity by introducing miner veto only makes the treasury system worse.\r\n\r\nI don't agree with the treasury, but if it will be implemented it has to be as simple and straight forward as possible as it gives transparency and accountability in the system on the decision makers (devs and super-voters) so they can't dilute their responsibility by pointing to anonymous miners for delays or bad decisions.\r\n\r\nIf there is going to be a treasury it should be a simple: miner tax -> fund -> proposal -> voting -> implementation.\r\n\r\nAny additional complexity, although it gives the impression of an illusory \"checks and balances\", actually diminishes it.\r\n\r\nThe treasury is not a technical proposal it's a social engineering proposal, so it must not be confused and obscured as technical.\r\n\r\nThe treasury has to be as straight forward and simple as possible, and SHOULD NOT give special powers to miners. If power is given to miners in addition to the prerogatives they already have in the system, then division of power between nodes, devs and miners is diminished: https://etherplan.com/2019/05/18/proof-of-work-has-division-of-power-proof-of-stake-does-not/7619/\r\n\r\nA clean treasury at least makes clear who is accountable.",
