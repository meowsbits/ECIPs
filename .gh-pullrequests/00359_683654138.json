That's the only protection we have.\r\n\r\nMoving back to Draft as per comment above.\r\n\r\nFor further work on RandomX I would kindly ask you to research the same as the SHA3 team and the Keccak256 team:\r\n- How would a transition look like (1 block, slow mining, hybrid, etc.)?\r\n- What change in difficulty would be required? How do hashrates compare on different hardware (can it be factorized)?\r\n- How would ETC hashrate compare to competitors (Monero, etc.)?",
