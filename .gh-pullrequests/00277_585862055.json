    "body": "The \"background stories\" linked by @sorpaas Sorpaas are good to have his viewpoints and to show how he uses falsehoods and manipulation to continue to obstruct the ECIP process.\r\n\r\nHis final \"Goodbye ETC!\" follows his typical pattern of attacks, falsehoods, and when he gets pushback from other participants he immediately threatens to quit.\r\n\r\nAs @sorpaas is very intelligent and has a high work ethic, he easily, and is welcome, to position himself in a key position in ETC as author of the ECIP process (ECIP-1000), developer of two critical clients (Parity and Multi-Geth), and \"editor\" in the ECIP-process.\r\n\r\nHowever, as seen on various ECIP PRs and documented discussions, he also has been:\r\n\r\n• Extremely disruptive in the process\r\n• Has claimed that rules exists when they don't\r\n• Accused various other participants of not following the process thus wishing bugs and vulnerabilities in ETC mainnet\r\n• Has claimed the ECIP process is as immutable as the blockchain when it's juts a production process subject to adjustment, especially if there are bugs or flaws found after the fact\r\n• Has doxxed other editors of the ECIP process who wished to remain pseudonymous\r\n• Finally he has threatened to leave, which, as he is a key figure in the ECIP process and development as explained above, is his leverage to force others to follow his demands\r\n\r\nAs an author of this ECIP-0001 I decided to write this new process to remove him as an author and editor, to clarify all the non-written rules he claims exist but don't, and welcome that he departs permanently from all his voluntary functions in ETC. I also request the \"owners\" of this repo to remove him from the organization completely so his ability to continue to disrupt the ECIP process, through his write and merge rights, is minimized.",
