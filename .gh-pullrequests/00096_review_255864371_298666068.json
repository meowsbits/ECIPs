The ECIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.\n+\n+We intend ECIPs to be the primary mechanism for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Ethereum Classic. The **ECIP author** is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.\n+\n+Because the ECIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.\n+\n+# Copyright\n+\n+This ECIP is licensed Apache-2, originally by [Luke Dashjr](https://github.com/luke-jr) under BSD 2-clause license.",
