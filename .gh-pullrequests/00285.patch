+was activated to the Mordor testnet.  It was no longer possible for the original Aztlán
+hardfork to be Withdrawn and replaced with this ECIP.
+
+The most likely path forward at the time of writing is for 
+[ECIP 1078: Phoenix EVM and Protocol Upgrades ("Aztlán redo")](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1061)
+to be moved to Last Call and to have block numbers assigned and to proceed with activation on
+Mordor and Kotti testnets slightly later than the Aztlán activation but activating on the same
+block for ETC mainnet.
+
+There will be a [Core Devs Call: ECIP-1078 Phoenix Upgrade](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/284)
+on Wednesday, February 05, 2019, 4pm UTC, 60 minutes max to make the final decision on this.

Subject: [PATCH 2/5] Set a review end date for Phoenix HF which is 8 weeks
 from today. Set block times for Mordor and Kotti as suggested by soc1c. Block
 for ETC mainnet activation is still TBD, but estimated as April/May/June.
 This means that Azltan+Phoenix is DELAYED from the earlier estimated 25th
 March 2020 target. The reason for the delay is a mixture of the
 unpredictability of block mining (estimate was made back in October) and the
 need for more time given the misspecification which let to the need for the
 Phoenix HF.

Subject: [PATCH 4/5] Decided that we might as well set the same ETC mainnet
 activation block for Phoenix as for Aztlan, even though that is still in
 May/June. We certainly would not want to activate any LATER if we can avoid
 it. And as per soc1c, we should avoid activation of Phoenix earlier than
 Azltan (too many edge-cases). So, for good or bad, I guess we are locked into
 block 10_500_839, even though it is much later than originally planned (March
 25th). Given the "fly in the ointment" of the mis-specification, perhaps that
 is a blessing in disguise.

This does NOT stop us starting work towards features and fixes which would likely land in the HF after Atzlan/Phoenix.
We can do those in parallel on other testnets (like Astor).

Subject: [PATCH 5/5] Using "approx" prefix to make clear that future dates are
 an approximate estimation. Meowbits suggested we remove the dates entirely,
 but I do not think that is a good idea. Humans do not think in blocks.
 However inaccurate these dates might be, humans like to make plans and that
 requires dates.
