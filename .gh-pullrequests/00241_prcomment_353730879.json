There, it can be discussed for inclusion in a future hard fork. If developers agree to include it, the ECIP editors will update the state of your ECIP to 'Accepted'.\n  - **For all other ECIPs**, open a PR changing the state of your ECIP to 'Final'. An editor will review your draft and ask if anyone objects to its finalization. If the editor decides there is no rough consensus - for instance, because contributors point out significant issues with the ECIP - they may close the PR and request that you fix the issues in the draft before trying again.\n-\n+ ",
