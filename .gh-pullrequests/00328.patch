+# Abstract
+
+The following describes a method of preventing a 51% attack on Ethash-based POW chains.
+
+# Motivation
+
+Ethereum CLassic suffered a number of 51% attacks already. [Here](https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-etc-102-screwed-after-second-51-attack) you can find an article from Cointelegraph describing the 51% attack on 6 Aug 2020. [Here](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-classic-51-attack-the-reality-of-proof-of-work) you can find another article describing the 51% attack on 10 Jan 2019. As long as ETC protocol remains unchanged it is susceptible for more 51% attacks.
+
+# Specification
+
+The proposed solution refers to the [PirlGuard protocol](https://pirl.io/en/pirlguard-innovative-solution-against-51-attacks/). 
+
+The description of the protocol states that instead of automatically syncing with any privately-mined chain branch the new protocol should require the peer proposing the privately-chain (and the reversal of the publicly mined and synced blocks) to mine  a number of "penalty" blocks. The number of penalty blocks must depend on the number of the original blocks that would be reverted if the chain will reorganize and sync to the proposed (privately-mined) branch. Thus the cost of the 51% attack will dramatically increase as the attacker will not be able to mine his private branch and then broadcast it to the network thus reverting all the transactions from the "main" branch.
+
+# Rationale
+
+This protocol is already implemented in Pirl and Callisto Network. The protocol has a working time tested reference implementation. The proposed change requires minimal modifications of the Ethereum CLassic protocol while offers a reliable method of protecting against the recent attacks and the relevant threat of newer similar attacks.
+
+# Backwards Compatibility
+
+Requires hardfork.
+
+# Implementations
+
+Here is a reference implementation of the protocol in GO lang: https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/go-callisto/blob/master/core/pirl_guard.go

+
+# Specification
+
+Basically a 51%-attack is a consensus mechanic flaw. Currently the nodes follow a rule of "the longest chain is always the right chain" however this is not what the chain users actually need in reality.
+
+In reality a chain where all the important entities are (i.e. bootnodes, exchange nodes, mining pool nodes, block explorer nodes etc.) remaining in consensus is the right chain. Here we rely on an assumption that this "right chain" is always in a more-or-less consensus state. This means that some independant parties may be lagging slightly (in case these are not yet synced with the whole chain's last block) or outracing the rest of the chain participants slightly (in case they are physically closer to the node which has found the latest block).
