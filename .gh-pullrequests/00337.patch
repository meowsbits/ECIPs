 # Specification
 
-The proposed solution refers to the [PirlGuard protocol](https://pirl.io/en/pirlguard-innovative-solution-against-51-attacks/). 
+The proposed solution refers to the [PirlGuard protocol](https://pirl.io/en/pirlguard-innovative-solution-against-51-attacks/).
 
 The description of the protocol states that instead of automatically syncing with any privately-mined chain branch the new protocol should require the peer proposing the privately-chain (and the reversal of the publicly mined and synced blocks) to mine  a number of "penalty" blocks. The number of penalty blocks must depend on the number of the original blocks that would be reverted if the chain will reorganize and sync to the proposed (privately-mined) branch. Thus the cost of the 51% attack will dramatically increase as the attacker will not be able to mine his private branch and then broadcast it to the network thus reverting all the transactions from the "main" branch.
