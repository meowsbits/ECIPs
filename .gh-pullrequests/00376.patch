 ### Abstract
-A proposal to replace the current Ethereum Classic proof of work algorithm with RandomX.
+
+A proposal to replace Ethereum Classic proof of work algorithm with `CPU-friendly RandomX` should `GPU-friendly Ethash` be rejected from the network.
 
 ### Motivation
-Ethereum Classic suffered a second round of 51% attacks due to dwindling hashrate on the Ethash algorithm.
 
-* [July 31, 2020](https://blog.bitquery.io/attacker-stole-807k-etc-in-ethereum-classic-51-attack)
-* [August 6, 2020](https://blog.bitquery.io/ethereum-classic-attack-8-august-catch-me-if-you-can).
+I am concerned with the centralized pro-ASIC movement in ECIP-1049 (and ECIP-1095) from a centralized body in ETC (ETC Coop, Commonwealth.gg, and EPIC Blockchain). I believe the self named `SHA3 Coalition` is not fully addressing the many concerns of miners/developers/end users regarding miner centralization, inflation capture, supply chain bottle necks, network security, interoperability with other EVMs, and a deviation from the core principles of Ethereum Classic network. 
+
+To date there are 27 meaningful unanswered comments written from high profile ETC network developers, large mining pools, small independent miners and independent end users. The champions of ECIP-1049 and ECIP-1095 proposals are not engaging these comments in their ECIP discussion threads. Due to the uncertainty of these unaddressed questions, a material opposition to ECIP-1049 has formed in the Ethereum Classic community.
 
-This ECIP is presented to provide an ASIC-resistant option for the discussion of switching to a new algorithm.
+It is my opinion that ECIP-1049, will not achieve the `Rough Consensus` requirement to push SHA3 ASIC on the network and Ethash GPU will likely prevail in that conversation. As an auxiliary path, this ECIP is being proposed to offer an alternative route to `consumer product, decentralized mining` via a CPU route.
 
-This PR is to compliment the algorithm discussions. If we consider an algorithm change this provides an ASIC-resistant option, opposed to the SHA3 all-in ASIC option.
