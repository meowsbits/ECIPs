 #### Developer Experience
 It becomes much easier to add a single "ethereum feature" into any software application. The app dev does not need to worry about any of the details of building a wallet/signer. They just create a string to be signed, and invoke the user's signer with it. The user expectation is only that they have _a_ signer, as opposed to some specific signer.
 
-<!-- Leaving the rpc call embedded, allows developers to continue to use existing tools for formating and decoding transactions and signatures. Using query string format for arbitrary variables will also allow experimentation with new features that can be ignored by non-supporting wallets. For instance, I'd like wallets to eventually be sent the `contractCode` and `compilerVerion` so they can verify the code and ABI. But I would not like to define any of that into the spec right now. Over time we can standardize certain variable names. -->

+This approach currently has a flaw that the name of the caller application is not sent to the invoked wallet, so handing control back to the caller app is very difficult. This can be worked around in an app-to-app setting (by passing it as part of the payload), but not in a browser-to-app setting (without complicated "browser sniffing" techniques).
