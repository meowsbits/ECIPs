    "body": "@gitr0n1n @q9f @bobsummerwill ECIPs can perfectly be moved back to draft. The ECIP process does not specifically say that it can't and the drawing is just a diagram. I drew it like that cause I was copying the Bitcoin one (see below) and for some reason put arrows instead of just lines. I guess I unconsciously put arrows as I was thinking in the forward process, and not about special cases where ECIPs needed to go backward.\r\n\r\n![bip-process](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29529586/106696238-80309000-6599-11eb-83ff-3a7ad990f4f6.png)\r\n\r\nThe ECIP process has predecessors in the BIP and EIP processes. EIP says clearly:\r\n\r\n```Last Call - This is the final review window for an EIP before moving to FINAL. An EIP editor will assign Last Call status and set a review end date (review-period-end), typically 14 days later.```\r\n\r\n```If this period results in necessary normative changes it will revert the EIP to REVIEW.```\r\n\r\n```Final - This EIP represents the final standard. A Final EIP exists in a state of finality and should only be updated to correct errata and add non-normative clarifications.```\r\n\r\n```Stagnant - Any EIP in DRAFT or REVIEW if inactive for a period of 6 months or greater is moved to STAGNANT. An EIP may be resurrected from this state by Authors or EIP Editors through moving it back to DRAFT.```\r\n\r\nBIP say clearly:\r\n\r\n```BIPs should be changed from Draft or Proposed status, to Rejected status, upon request by any person, if they have not made progress in three years. Such a BIP may be changed to Draft status if the champion provides revisions that meaningfully address public criticism of the proposal, or to Proposed status if it meets the criteria required as described in the previous paragraph.```\r\n\r\nI tried to change the diagram when Wei Tang was harassing the ETC ecosystem arguing the same thing about no backward status changes. The supposed impossibility of moving ECIPs backward to draft was always false, because it is obvious that when an ECIP has a catastrophic problem, no matter what is the status, they have to be moved back to draft to correct issues (as prescribed by the BIP and EIP). \r\n\r\nThis has happened in ETH, but I don't remember what case it was.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, ECIPs can be moved to draft (I co-wrote ECIP-1000). I will enter the corrected diagram to the assets folder so it is corrected and does not create these confusions again.\r\n\r\nWei was controlling the ECIP-1000 repo at the time of the argument and constantly sabotaging other ECIPs and commentary as he had editor, writing, and author access and authority. That is why I could never change the diagram.",
