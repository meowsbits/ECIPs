Unbounded exponential growth for the antigravity function serves no purpose beyond some point.\n+\n+#### Costs\n+\n+- Nodes subject to eclipse attacks (mostly considered as nodes coming online after a long time or starting out) are vulnerable to destitution, even once released. This is addressed by the function's ceiling causing the attacker to establish a total difficulty 1/31x of the competing honest chain, and can be addressed further by the operator including a checkpoint value.\n+- It may be anticipated that the network uncle and waste rates will rise slightly, as blocks that would otherwise be [randomly included](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ie53/publications/btcProcFC.pdf) will be rejected. ETC currently has a 3.5% uncle rate compared to ETH's 5.5%.\n+\n+\n+#### Discussion of Constant Parameters\n+\n+The _sin_ function uses constant parameters `period = 2pi/8000` and `amplitude = 15`, the values of which are reasoned as follows.\n+\n+The _period_ value of `2pi/8000` causes the peak of the sin wave (and ultimate ceiling) to occur at 25132 seconds (approximately 7 hours). This falls in between the rates of the previously considered exponential functions. The \"ramp up\" domain (nearest `x=0`) sees a flattened curve, yielding a more generous lenience for competing short segments. The _sin_ curve eventually intersects the original exponential function at about 900 seconds (15 minutes) at about `y=1.09`.\n+\n+The _amplitude_ value of `15` causes the peak to occur at `(2*15)+1 = 31`. This value means that the maximum \"antigravity\" an attack will face is a 31, where the proposed chain would need a total difficulty 31 times that of the chain it would replace. \n+\n+The _phase shift_ of `1.5pi * 8000` is trivially derivable by seeking `f(0) = 1`.\n+\n+These values were chosen for ETC with the following assumptions and reasoning.\n+\n+- Assume global Ethash hashrate availability is 200TH.\n+- Assume greatest single Ethash mining _entity_ is 33% of the global, yielding about 66TH. This is considered as the largest possible antagonist for the ETC chain.\n+- Assume ETC has 3TH total contributed hashrate.\n+- Following this, we deduce that the largest Ethash mining entity has 22 times of ETC's current mining power. An \"attack\" by this entity on ETC would result in a `(66/(66+3))*100 = 95`% attack. \n+- Given a 22x anticipated \"reasonable\" worst-case scenario, the amplitude of `15` yielding a total `31` ceiling, around 50% above the anticipated worst-case scenario, is intended to be sufficiently future-proof and resilient to unforeseen scenarios.\n+\n+#### Alternatives Considered\n+\n+An bounded exponential function would work in much the same way, although it would not have a continuous ceiling transition and would, in a far-edge case, present an exploitable focal point of vulnerability at that transition.\n+\n+### Comparative Visualizations of (Anti)Gravity Functions\n+\n+![mess-sin-far](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45600330/92998206-2510da80-f4de-11ea-9220-4aeebb1c3cdf.png)\n+\n+![mess-sin-close](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45600330/92998205-217d5380-f4de-11ea-841b-f49cc4192721.png)\n+\n+The graphs below show a 200 block chain accepting, sidechaining, or rejecting reorganizations of varying relative difficulty and length.\n+\n+![nomess-acceptreject](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45600330/92998210-2a6e2500-f4de-11ea-9c25-3e20bde41ef1.png)\n+\n+![mess-acceptreject](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45600330/92998215-2fcb6f80-f4de-11ea-8af9-178d905c9086.png)\n+\n+## Implementation\n+\n+This feature does not require a hard fork, but the network stands to benefit and avoid risk with majority coordinated acivation.\n+\n+__Core-Geth__\n+\n+- Feature is tentatively proposed to activate in Core-Geth on Ethereum Classic network at and above block 11295300.\n+- Feature is proposed to activate in Core-Geth on Ethereum Classic's Mordor test network at and above block 2290740.\n+\n+- Core-Geth feature implementation includes a few additional safety mechanisms:\n+  + MESS is disabled for any sync mode besides full sync.\n+  + MESS is only enabled once a peer has completed initial chain synchronisation, not while they are fast syncing or even full syncing during the download and process phase. This reduces the chances of a node coming online being lured into an eclipse scenario.\n+  + MESS is only enabled if a peer has greater than or equal to the `2 * MinimumSyncPeers` peers. In Core-Geth this value is by default `5`, yielding a necessary limit of `10` for the MESS feature.\n+  + MESS is disabled if, once synced, a node's head block is not changed within a time limit (ie becomes stale).  In Core-Geth this value is by default `10 * 13 seconds`.\n+  \n+The associated Core-Geth implementation is available [here](https://github.com/etclabscore/core-geth/pull/181).\n+\n+## References\n+\n+- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=865169.msg16349234#msg16349234\n+- https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity/\n+\n+Bespoke previously considered exponential functions:\n+\n+```go\n+/*\n+ecbp1100AGExpB is an exponential function with x as a base (and rationalized exponent).\n+\n+OPTION 2: Slightly slower takeoff, steeper eventual ascent\n+g(x)=x^(x*0.00002)\n+*/\n+func ecbp1100AGExpB(x float64) (antiGravity float64) {\n+\treturn math.Pow(x, x*0.00002)\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```go\n+/*\n+ecbp1100AGExpA is an exponential function with x as exponent.\n+\n+This was (one of?)
