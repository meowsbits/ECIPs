    "body": "> I think we can continue working on that document, so I would rather send it back to draft status rather than rejecting it.\r\n\r\nCan that direct movement to `Draft` be made? source: the ECIP diagram.\r\n\r\nI see that `Last Call` status can only be moved to `Accepted` or `Rejected`.\r\n\r\n`Last Call - An ECIP that is done with its initial iteration and ready for review by a wider audience.`\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/raw/master/assets/ecip-1000/process.png\r\n\r\nPedantic, but thats how the Editors have chosen to follow the ECIP process for all ECIPs.\r\n\r\nSo move ECIP-1049 to Rejected. Alex resubmits the materially changed `reDraft` proposal to `Draft` status. Will that require a new ECIP # (like all the Aztlan proposals)?  @q9f I think if we did that, it would accomplish the end goal of getting Alex's new proposal back to draft status for review. The new ECIP # aligns with the desire for a new discussion thread as well.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I agree with you that it should END in draft status. However you think that should happen.",
