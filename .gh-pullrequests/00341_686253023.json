    "body": "Second objection: is this also implying SHA3 as a blanket replacement for all uses of Keccak-256?  This would be _devastating_ to the ecosystem tooling.  All of the EthereumMainnet tooling would have to be forked because Keccak is used almost everywhere.  From transaction hashing to block identification hashing.  Client side and server side code would all have to be forked and variant copies maintained everywhere.\r\n\r\nThis broad of a change is like shooting yourself in the foot with a nuclear warhead.  This ECIP should have it's scope reduced to just proof of work hashing or summarily rejected for the sake of the ecosystem.",
