+
+### Simple Summary
+
+This ECIP describes a hard-fork which would replace
+[ECIP 1061: Aztlán EVM and Protocol Upgrades (Yingchun Edition)](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1061) to "fix" two issues with ECIP-1061 where the written specification
+did not match the original intent.
+
+Enable the outstanding Ethereum Foundation _Istanbul_ network protocol upgrades on the Ethereum
+Classic network without any gas-cost assumptions in a hard-fork code-named _Phoenix_ to enable 
+maximum compatibility across these networks.
+
+
+### Abstract
+
+Add support for a subset of protocol-impacting changes introduced in the Ethereum Foundation (ETH) network via the
+_Istanbul_ hardforks. The proposed changes for Ethereum Classic's _Phoenix_ upgrade include:
+
+- Add Blake2 compression function `F` precompile
+- Reduce alt_bn128 precompile gas costs
+- Add ChainID opcode
+- Calldata gas cost reduction
+- Net gas metering for SSTORE without dirty maps
+- Addition of SELFBALANCE opcode
+
+The network participants who took part in the
+[ETC Core Developers call](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/177) on 27th November 2019
+were under the impression at the time that the scope we agreed ("Instanbul without the
+backward-compatibility breaking parts of EIP-1884") - ECIP-1061 / ECIP-1072 - would move the ETC
+protocol to a place where it was 100% compatible with the ETH mainnet.
+
+[Wei Tang](https://github.com/sorpaas)'s implementation of ECIP-1061 shortly afterwards revealed
+two flaws in the specification, together with recommendations on how to address those shortcomings.
+
+This ECIP codifies [those recommendations](https://specs.corepaper.org/51-aztlanredo) in the form
+of a replacement hard-fork which would happen instead of
+[ECIP 1061: Aztlán EVM and Protocol Upgrades (Yingchun Edition)](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1061) on a timeline still TDB.
+
+
+### Motivation
+
+To enhance the Ethereum Virtual Machine's (EVM) capabilities, various opcodes shall be added to the Ethereum Classic
+networks, all of which have been in use on the Ethereum Foundation networks since end of 2019.
+
+
+### Specification
+
+This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the Classic networks:
+
+- TBD on Mordor Classic PoW-testnet
+- TBD Kotti Classic PoA-testnet
+- TBD on Ethereum Classic PoW-mainnet
+
+After HARD_FORK_BLOCK, apply the following changes.
+
+- Enable [EIP-152](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-152)
+- Enable [EIP-1108](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1108)
+- Enable [EIP-1344](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1344)
+- Enable [EIP-2028](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2028)
+- Enable [EIP-1283](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1283) with [EIP-1706](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1706).
+- Enable [50-SELFBALANCE](https://specs.corepaper.org/50-selfbalance) - TODO - create an ECIP for this.
+
+
+### Rationale
+
+[ECIP 1061: Aztlán EVM and Protocol Upgrades (Yingchun Edition)](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1061) as defined is "broken" and it would be inadvisable to activate on the ETC mainnet in
+its current state.
+
+Two better options are:
+
+1. "fix it" and proceed on the existing timeline, if there is enough time to do that.
+2. Withdraw it and build consensus for a new HF on a more conservative timeline.
+
+
+### Implementation
+
+Adoption of the content of this ECIP requires a hard fork as it introduces changes that are not backward compatible.
+
+The following clients with Ethereum Classic support implement the _Istanbul_ features currently:
+
+- Parity Ethereum
+- Multi-Geth
+- Hyperledger Besu
+
+The author is unaware if any of these clients have implemented [EIP-1706](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1706), but it is a very simple change, analogous to [EIP-2200](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2200), which all the
+codebases have already implemented.
+
+Similarly [50-SELFBALANCE](https://specs.corepaper.org/50-selfbalance) has not been implemented in any of these
+codebases, but is just a "remix" of code which they have already implemented.
