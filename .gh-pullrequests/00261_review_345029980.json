    "body": "While this ECIP is merge-able, I want to point out that there is not enough time to implement Aztlan-fix on the same block as Aztlan. We've just had several design flaws in ECIP-1061 because the proper ECIP process was bypassed, and also because there were not sufficient time for reviews. Phoenix definitely needs to learn those lessons from Aztlan and give sufficient time for reviews and testing.\r\n\r\nAlso a small note that this together with #263 is conflicting with #221 vs #224, but this won't be an issue with the current active ECIP process.",
