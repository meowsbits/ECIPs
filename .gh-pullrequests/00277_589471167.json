    "body": "Recently I commented on Discord that I would give @sorpaas the benefit of the doubt and expected that perhaps he would reconsider being over focused on \"process\" and decided to continue building in the ETC ecosystem. If he did reconsider, I offered to take out his proposed removal from this ECIP-0001, thus leaving him as an editor.\r\n\r\nHowever, today: \r\n\r\nA) he not only didn't deny that he knew about a flaw in ECIPs he was pushing, which is very concerning in itself, but \r\n\r\nB) he insisted that implementing changes, even with flaws known to him, is perfectly necessary because according to him it is more important to follow the process and what \"the community\" decides than prioritizing the security of the network.\r\n\r\nAs B is such an extreme lack of judgement and A just plain malicious, I am no longer giving him the benefit of the doubt and continue to recommend his removal as editor and if possible removal from the ETC Github organization in general.\r\n\r\nI am posting his tweets here to back of what I wrote above:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-02-20 at 7 00 32 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29529586/74999088-def80a80-5417-11ea-9426-b4f7a0b67411.png)",
