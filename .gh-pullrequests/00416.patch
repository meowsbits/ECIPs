+### Abstract ###
+
+The purpose of this ECIP is to protect the eyesight and sanity of Ethereum Classic users; for too long our community has suffered from 
+the blinding glare of unadulterated light-colored websites. Times must change.
+
+Further, this progressive step will act decisively to differentiate the ecosystem from Ethereum's tasteless light mode preference. 
+
+### Motivation ###
+
+Over 70% of software engineers use dark theme IDEs to work, yet most websites in the ecosystem default to light mode. 
+If we wish to attract more developers we need to not only embrace dark mode, but fully commit, by removing support for light mode all together. 
+
+Not only will this benefit users' health, but it will be a major differentiating factor between Ethereum Classic and Ethereum, 
+giving us a major long term edge. 20 years from now, would you prefer to have 20/20 vision and perfect health, or be feeble and blind?
+
+### Parameters ###
+
+Hue, value, and saturation are the major variables in play.
+
+How dark do we go? 
+
+Exact configurations will be determined via onchain voting, between the following candidates:
+
+1. #000000
+2. #0a0a0a
+3. #111111
+4. #1a1a1a
+5. #222222
+6. #2a2a2a
+7. #333333
+
+In case of a failed vote, the default will be candidate _4: #1a1a1a_.
+
+### Specification ###
+
+The background of the body element must be set to the determined candidate. e.g:
+
+```
+body {
+  background-color: #1a1a1a !important;
+}
+```
+
+> Note, it is important that `!important` is set, even if the CSS does not need to be explicitly overridden.
+> More than an incidental stylesheet keyword, this is politically relevant and elucidates the design intentions of the authors.
+
+Voting Begins: TBD 
+Voting Ends: TBD
+
+Activation Block: 13190000 (suggested)
+
+### Implementation ###
+
+All ETC websites/dapps/apps (IMPACTED INFRASTRUCTURE) must implement dark mode, using the determined parameters before the agreed activation block. They must also remove support for light mode.
+
+IMPACTED INFRASTRUCTURE can be defined as any website existing on the internet containing the term `ETC` or `etc`.
+
+Any IMPACTED INFRASTRUCTURE failing to upgrade in the time period will be fined 42ETC per minute for failed compliance.
+Revenue from this tax, if any, will be used to fund Mantis development.
+
