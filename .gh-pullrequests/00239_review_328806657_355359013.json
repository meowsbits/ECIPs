    "body": "Playing the devil's advocate here:\r\nWhat if someone does something other than doxing, say SWATing, deep-fakes of loved ones, etc. because they don't like an ECIP you proposed. \r\n\r\nThat won't be covered by doxing but should be covered by harassment.\r\n\r\nI think trolling is fine if its just for shit and giggles. Personal attacks I'm not sure about since they can be very subjective. Say we remove them then until we have a better definition. Political attacks I feel have been going on for a while in the community (calling someone a communist or a stupid liberal, etc.) I just don't know what one should do in this case. We can remove it until we also have a better definition of it.\r\n\r\nWe should be able to leave room for dissent and instigation since it's what keeps our process honest. Maybe you can provide a draft for something you have in mind in regards to that?",
