    "body": "No one is `freaking out`. I came back to find my proposal was rejected in swift motion. I read the information and accept it. Then today I was asked to express my opinion in the thread via the `dev-core` channel.\r\n\r\nI have done everything that has been asked of me related to this new ECIP.\r\n\r\nRegarding the CDC agenda, it is obvious these agendas were not clearly communicated to the public as many were left confused by not only the 8/20 meeting but the 8/28 meeting. I had no idea `RandomX was on the chopping block`. No idea at all. There was no 8/20 recording to review outside of some very vague bullet list. And the 8/28 meeting had silence regarding the topic.\r\n\r\nMoving this prematurely to `Reject` status after 21 days from the moment it was drafted is irresponsible as a consensus coordinator.",
