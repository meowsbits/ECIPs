    "body": "As this ECIP was rejected on proper grounds, following the ECIP process to a \"T\", the author, Ronin, must draft a new ECIP while this one stays rejected. Its crucial we don't give one group or individual preferential treatment just because they are incessantly harassing you here and in discord. All he has to do is draft either the same one or make some changes if he wants but it must be a new ECIP to follow the process. Once rejected, an ECIP **cannot** magically be un-rejected. ",
