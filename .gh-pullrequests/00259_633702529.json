    "body": "I think this is a great proposal and look forward to working on it after Phoenix is activated. A few thoughts: \r\n\r\n* I personally like either of the two gas limit functions proposed and believe something that approximates Moore's law - gas limit doubles every 2 years seems like a good target to shoot for.\r\n\r\n* One advantage of this, is that it would allow network participants to provision for \"maximum scenario\" disk storage requirements. For example:\r\n\r\n\"I know between now and 2 years from now, a 2mil gas block will be at most 5KB [1], assuming 13second blocks, there will be around 5mil blocks before a gas limit increase. Based on 5KB * 5mil = 25GB. I will only need a 25GB hard disk for the next 2 years\"\r\n\r\nThese numbers are somewhat rooted in reality, but when this gets deployed we should be able to propose this information as a node-operator standard.\r\n\r\nUltimately in favor of this proposal, and looking to see how it progresses. \r\n\r\n[1] https://ethgasstation.info/blog/ethereum-block-size/\r\n",
