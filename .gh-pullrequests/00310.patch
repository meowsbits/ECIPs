Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Fixed url capitalization - added language to include
 controversies
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

• ECIP -> ecip

• Added language "including, but not limited to" in the phrase that clarifies that devs/editors can change ECIPs to previous statuses in the case in the examples but also if other major events occur, such as the recent ProgPow controversy after EIP-1057 was moved to accepted. The text modified was:

"However, core developers and editors can decide to move ECIPs back to previous statuses after the fact, or to `Rejected` or `Withdrawn` status, at their discretion provided there is reasonable cause, ***including but not limited to,*** a major, but correctable, flaw was found in the ECIP, a major but not correctable flaw was found in the ECIP."
