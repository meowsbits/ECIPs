+## Recommended Implementation
+
+Two variables directly control the dag size growth cacheSize and datasetSize 
+
+ - cacheSize is the size of the ethash verification cache that belongs to a certain block number.  The cache size grows linearly, however, we always take the highest prime below the linearly growing threshold in order to reduce the risk of accidental regularities leading to cyclic behavior
+ 
+ - DatasetSize is the size of the ethash mining dataset that belongs to a certain block number. The dataset size grows linearly, however, we always take the highest prime below the linearly growing threshold in order to reduce the risk of accidental regularities leading to cyclic behavior.
+ 
+These values are calculated as blockNumber / epochLength. To set the dag growth to a number smaller than what would occur through the normal calculation. A Magic Dag Epoch block is of `42` replaces `blockNumber / epochLength` as the epoch number after the fork block and when the dag is calculated in the future this epoch is always used. Dag generation is uneffected and both cache and data size will pepertually be 22281536 and 1426062464 respectivly. 
+ 
+```
+//run prior to calculating cacheSize or dataSize 
+
+ if (blocknumber > ECIP1043Transition) {
+		epoch := 42
+	} else {
+		epoch := int(block / epochLength)
+	}
+```

 ## Risks Consideration
 * This ECIP is not forward compatible and introduces backwards incompatibilities in the DAG file generation, block verification, and block mining. Therefore, it should be included in a scheduled hardfork at a certain block number.
 * This is a long term PRO applicaton specific hardware proposal. If sufficient interest is not generated by manufactures in the mining field, there is risk of domination by one or more manufactures. (market risk)
