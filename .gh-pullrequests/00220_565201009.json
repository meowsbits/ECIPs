    "body": "@bobsummerwill I do not know why anything else you said matters here. \r\n\r\nA breach of the process is a breach of the process, no matter how many times you want to waste people's time to reframe it. This is the same as `ethereumproject` org takeoever -- no matter how many times you try to reframe it, a hostile takeover is a hostile takeover.\r\n\r\nIf you were being rational, you should have been putting arguments out the first day when the process breach happened, not posting random angry comments several weeks after the breach. Now it pretty apparent who is wasting everyone's time.\r\n\r\n",
