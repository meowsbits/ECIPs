    "body": "> For further work on RandomX I would kindly ask you to research the same as the SHA3 team and the Keccak256 team:\r\n> \r\n> * How would a transition look like (1 block, slow mining, hybrid, etc.)?\r\n> * What change in difficulty would be required? How do hashrates compare on different hardware (can it be factorized)?\r\n> * How would ETC hashrate compare to competitors (Monero, etc.)?\r\n\r\nPlease add this ECIP-1093 feedback to the ECIP discussion thread https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/329 . Thank you for closing this PR.",
