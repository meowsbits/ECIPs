    "body": "With my latest understanding of EIP2200 `SLOAD` gas specification (and related patches), it seems to me that ECIP1086 is invalid/useless, since because EIP2200 does _not_ specify `SLOAD` gas=800, no patch should be implemented (or now, should actually be reverted in some client cases), and ECIP1086 as a \"retrospective allowance\" for the EIP2200 gas=200 become a no-op.",
