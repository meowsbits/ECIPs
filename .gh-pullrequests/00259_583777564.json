    "body": "You asked \"what from\" on the gaslimit, @meowsbits?\r\n\r\nHere is a historical graph of the ETH gaslimit, which I believe that ETC has pretty much inherited by mistake due to whatever the Parity-Ethereum defaults have been:\r\n\r\nhttps://etherscan.io/chart/gaslimit\r\n\r\nThe limit was lowered at the time of the Shanghai attacks in Sep/Oct/Nov 2016 or so and you can see a dip in the historical progression there, but you can see in general it was:\r\n\r\n3M during 2015\r\n4.7M during 2016 to mid 2017 (barring dip for the attacks)\r\n6.7M mid 2017 to late 2017\r\n8.0M during 2018 and until Sep 2019\r\n10M since Sep 2019.\r\n\r\nFull-syncs are horrific now on ETH:  https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/1217488290900848640\r\n\r\nSee also articles like:  https://hackernoon.com/the-ethereum-blockchain-size-has-exceeded-1tb-and-yes-its-an-issue-2b650b5f4f62",
