 * **Work in progress (WIP)** -- An ECIP where the author has asked the Ethereum Classic community whether an idea has any chance of support, he/she will write a draft ECIP as a pull request. However, if the idea is still in a very early stage, and will have a lot of commits and changes by the author, editors or contributors, it may be better to enter it as a WIP. Make sure to add [WIP] in the title (example: [WIP] ECIP-X) of the early stage ECIP so other members can mute it if they are not interested in participating at this stage. 
 * **Draft** - An ECIP that is still undergoing iteration and changes, but is ready for general review. Make sure to remove [WIP] from the title so those who have muted the ECIP get the new status and can participate.

 ## ECIPs Historical Background
 
 ECIPs were born out of the [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs) (or Ethereum Foundation) EIP repository after [TheDAO hard fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)). At that time no other differences between Ethereum Classic (the original mainnet) and Ethereum existed besides TheDAO hard-fork. Changes have since been added such as the early defusal of the difficulty bomb and a change of the monetary policy to a fixed supply.
