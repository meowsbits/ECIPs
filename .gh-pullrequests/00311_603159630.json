Please review for the original EIP documents for rationale.\r\n\r\n> Would it be helpful for the ETC fork metadata in Core-Geth to up upstreamed to Geth as well, or does it not make a difference?\r\n\r\n`forkid` is a function of chain configuration. Thus, you can't \"upstream metadata\" without upstream the chain config, which ethereum/go-ethereum is reluctant to accept at this point.",
