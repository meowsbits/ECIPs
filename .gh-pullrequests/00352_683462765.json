    "body": "Response from the ECIP-1093 Author.\r\n\r\nMy personal opinions on this broken consensus building process:\r\nI was not informed that RandomX was on the chopping block. The Agenda for this call was still listed as \"To be Determined\". Also the chat regarding the agenda about an hour from the call time cited an unrecorded CDC call where this proposal was \"rejected\" due to vocal opposition via in discord @developerkevin, but there is no transparency to this opposition. I suggest this ECIP be sent to `draft` status for proper discussion time.\r\n\r\nI had drafted the proposal and there was minimal community engagement with the recent flood of ECIPs due to the current unstable state of the network. After 21 days from drafting and sumitting ECIP-103, this decision to reject the proposal feels rushed to say the least. Additionally this decision cited an unrecorded meeting 14 days after drafting the proposal. This is hardly enough time to digest this proposal. I haven't directly heard/read opposition to this proposal or discussion at all since the ECIP is so new compared to other ECIPs that sat in the draft stage for years and were provided adequate time to digest the proposal material.\r\n\r\nTo me, this auto-rejection without adequate dicussion time seems similar to how ProgPoW was rushed through to rejection status by the pro-SHA3 participants (ETC Coop and others).\r\n\r\nLastly, I later learned that other ECIP authors were contacted prior to the meeting regarding their attendance to the call, specifically Alex of ECIP-1049 by Arfi the call coordinator. So it does not feel that this ECIP was given a proper chance for the community to digest it. I recommend it be sent back to the `Draft` status so it is on the table for further review should a material opposition to SHA3 grow now that ECIP-1049 \"SHA3\" has been pushed through the process to accepted status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegardless of those personal feelings on the matter:\r\nI reviewed the 8/28 CDC call and did not hear a champion present on the call: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W1l5krLPqI\r\n\r\nI was not around the computer or in cell phone range to attend the CDC as I was out of cell service for an engagement that was scheduled months before the CDC call was scheduled. Due to being a believer of `rough consensus` and proper `process`, I have to accept the `Reject` status if other attending members in the ECIP process feel it is justified and this proposal got a \"fair shake\". \r\n\r\nShould a material opposition to the SHA3 algorithm discussion form and participant in the ECIP process, I will champion to have this ECIP returned to `draft` status from `rejected` as I don't believe this philosophical conversation has been thoroughly discussioned as Charles of Input Output Global addressed in his criticism of the initial 8/20 2020 Q3 CDC meeting that was not recorded for public consumption:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/F0lR_u7BVho?t=480",
