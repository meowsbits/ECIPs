    "body": "Isn't this moving a little too quickly for a mainnet activation on Sep. 29? If the network is attacked only core-geth nodes running MESS will remain on a chain while the other clients fracture off. Could this be something we discuss as a affected stakeholders and node operators? After all this did not go through the various stages of attaining a rough consensus per each graduation of ECIP levels as it is not exactly a hard fork.as stated above.\r\n\r\nWe still need assurances from those running core-geth clients that they've updated. We at the Co-op need to actually implement this into Besu if we are to reduce the risk of network fracturing given a 51% attack. I'm looking forward to discussing this tomorrow at 7AM PST.",
