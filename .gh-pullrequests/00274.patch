+ecip: ECIP number TBD
+title: Proposal for owner, member, editor, & author removal
+author: Donald McIntyre (@TokenHash)
+discussions-to: https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/273
+status: Draft
+type: Meta

+
+### Proposal
+
+I propose Wei Tang (@sorpaas) be expelled from the Ethereum Classic organization as a 'member' or 'owner' whatever is his role there. I also propose for him to be taken out as an 'editor' in the ECIP process, namely ECIP-1000, and that ECIP-1000 be replaced with a new clean 'process' ECIP with a new author, so Sorpaas is removed from that position as well.
+
+### Rationale
+
+He doxxed two editors in ECIP-1000 and fails to correct that doxxing even after being called out for it.
+Abuses his position as ECIP 'editor' and ECIP-1000 'author' to impose false process rules and procedures that only advance his ideas and agenda.
+He constantly lies about how the ECIP process 'should' be according to imaginary rules he makes up, just to stop others from opining and introducing their ideas.
+He is persistently abusive and bully to other developers and contributors by threatening and telling them they 'want bugs' on ETC and that they promote a new 'theDAO'.
+He falsely creates an equivalency between the operating blockchain and the ECIP process as if the ECIP process were as sacred as the blockchain, and property and agreements within it.
+
+### Motivation
+
+In general, Sorpaas has become a very negative participant, is inhibiting others from freely participating in the development process, and abuses his quadruple position as a client developer, ETC Github member, ECIP editor, and ECIP-1000 author.
+
+For the above I make this proposal for his removal from all those positions in the ETC ecosystem.
+
+### Implementation
+
+When this ECIP is accepted by rough consensus, the modifications proposed could be implemented by Ethereum Classic Organization owners on Github and ECIP editors directly on the corresponding ECIPs.
