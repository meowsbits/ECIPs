    "body": "Here's the reply from you, on 11/10/2019, requesting me to remove MulanPSL from ECIP-1000:\r\n\r\n> I want MulanPSL for ETC.  Truly.   But we cannot just put it in there without discussion.   We cannot just change ECIP-1000 when that goes beyond \"small fixes\" to formatting, meta-data, etc.\r\n> ...\r\n> No - I would not call for that.   Metadata and formatting changes are fine.\r\n> Adding a new license is not.\r\n> Instead - make a new ECIP to \"Add MulanPSL\".   Have the discussion on that in Github.\r\n> Add it on the agenda for a pending meeting.\r\n> It will pass.\r\n> Done.\r\n> Can probably happen Nov 21st.\r\n\r\nYou're clearly using the argument of the convention mentioned above, to demand me to follow you request. I had reservations but still, decided to follow the convention you mentioned, and thus I removed MulanPSL. It's a blatant lie of you to suggest that I did not follow the convention, or to suggest that the convention was made out from thin air. It was originated from you, even!",
