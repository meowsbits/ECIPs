    "body": "> Well, thanks for the honest feedback, I try to make _less disaster_ next time.\r\n\r\nThis verbage was not feedback from me personally, but many others in the discord server. I was not present at the meeting to witness it and there was no recording for the CDC. So i cannot personally opine on the 8/20 meeting. However I did listen to Charles' video with constructive feedback of the meeting. This was reviewed as I tried to piece together what happened to my newly submitted ECIP proposal and why it was in `Reject` status since there is no documentation regarding this discussion on this ECIP.\r\n\r\n> If you do believe there is an improvement to be made, please go ahead and help iterating the process. \r\n\r\nI am trying to improve the process with my feedback in this thread. As an author, you shot down my proposal prior to any constructive dialogue on the proposal. I'm left thinking, why did I even put the effort if some random person can censor ECIPs in this way?\r\n\r\n>Blaming each other does not help Ethereum Classic at all. And I'm not doing this for myself, I'm doing this for Ethereum Classic.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, rushing newly drafted ECIPs is not productive for the Ethereum Classic ECIP process. ECIP-1043 and ECIP-1049 sat in the draft status for at least `one year`. This was a CPU algorithm change suggestion to compliment the GPU and ASIC discussion. It has merit and deserves better treatment.\r\n\r\nThanks for listening to the feedback.",
