 ### Simple Summary
 
 Enable the outstanding Ethereum Foundation _Istanbul_ network protocol upgrades on the Ethereum
-Classic network without any gas-cost assumptions in a hard-fork code-named _Aztlán (Yingchun Edition)_ to enable 
-maximum compatibility across these networks.

-The _Yingchun_ Edition refers to the preferred variant of _Aztlán_ without any repricing of state-trie 
-dependent opcodes as previously proposed in [ECIP-1072](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1072).

 __Immutability__: None of the introduced new opcodes in the EVM has the potential to change the behavior of existing
 contracts; in the case where previously an arbitrary invalid bytecode would have been deployed to the network, none of
 them would be able to modify the state of the Ethereum Classic networks retrospectively. Adding opcodes to the EVM
