    "body": "The intention of this PR seems terribly wrong.\r\n\r\n* There are no explanations what makes it \"doxing of ECIP editors\". The real name of Isaac and Afri have been there since the beginning of ECIP process. Afri and Isaac both accepted it when they're proposed to be ECIP editors. I've only seen Afri using the \"doxing\" argument to hide his wrongdoings for bypassing the ECIP process in ECIP-1061, which is inapproriate.\r\n* Editors are public facing figures of the ECIP process. The reason why the editor process works is that responsibilities can be traced. If editors are all anonymous, we will have no idea of the responsibilities and it will have serious consequences of credibility for ECIP as a whole. This, of course, does not mean that anonymous figures cannot participate in ECIP process -- they can, just not as public facing ECIP editors.\r\n* As a convention, ECIP-1000 should be updated by supplying amendment ECIPs. When those amendment ECIPs moved to final, the changes can be applied to ECIP-1000. This PR failed to follow the convention.",
