    "body": "Moving something back from \"Accepted\" to \"Draft\" has never happened in the entire Ethereum and Ethereum Classic hard fork history. The issue here is that implementations will assume that an \"Accepted\" specification is implement-able, and will move on to implement it. If we allow changing the spec again arbitrarily, then those implementations will have no specifications to refer to.\r\n\r\nIn another words, this change severely damage the reputation and credibility of the whole ECIP process.",
