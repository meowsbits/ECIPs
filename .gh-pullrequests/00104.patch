+## Summary
 
 This document is a summary of the Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposal (ECIP) process. To view the full description of the ECIP process please read [ECIP-1000](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1000) which is the formal document generally acknowledged by the Ethereum Classic (ETC) ecosystem, by [rough consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus), as the most suitable system to propose new standard changes to the ETC protocol, informational documents, or ECIP process suggestions.

 After reading [ECIP-1000](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1000), fork the repository and add your ECIP to it, using the provided [ECIP markdown template](./ecip-X.md). Submit by creating a Pull Request to the Ethereum Classic [ECIPs repository](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs).

These discussions are located in public forums, Github or developer calls. Discussion participants may be core or volunteer Ethereum Classic client developers, any developers on Github willing to contribute their well reasoned opinions, and other interested stakeholders or participants in the ETC ecosystems.

 * **Rejected** - Reasons for rejecting ECIPs include duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, unfocused or too broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation, or obvious popular disapproval.
 * **Withdrawn** - ECIP authors may decide to change the status between Draft, Deferred, or Withdrawn. The ECIP editor may also change the status to Deferred if no progress is being made on the ECIP.

 Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals (ECIPs), are technical write-ups that describe suggested changes to the Ethereum Classic Protocol. Finalized proposals agreed by core and volunteer client developers, implementers and other users of the Ethereum Classic mainnet are implemented by the core developer team into their respective clients.

 Having an ECIP within the folder of the repository does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes "Final". For an ECIP to become Final it requires the common consent of the ecosystem. Those proposing changes should consider that, ultimately, consent may rest with the consensus of the Ethereum Classic implementers and users.
 
-# ECIPs Historical Background
+## ECIPs Historical Background
 
 ECIPs were born out of the [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs) (or Ethereum Foundation) EIP repository after [TheDAO hard fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)). At that time no other differences between Ethereum Classic (the original mainnet) and Ethereum existed besides TheDAO hard-fork. Changes have since been added such as the early defusal of the difficulty bomb and a change of the monetary policy to a fixed supply.

 The Ethereum Foundation raised money from the community to work towards the "mission to promote and support research, development and education to bring decentralized protocols", but failed at that goal when, shortly after TheDAO exploit, Vitalik Buterin announced, using the Ethereum Foundation blog, that they had already unilaterally decided to fork. A [chat log](http://pastebin.com/raw/aMKwQcHR) from an internal chat reveals this decision was made prior to the announcement, and comments like "default behavior of Geth to be pro-fork as per internal discussions" found in DAO hard-fork [pull requests](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/2814), and the unwillingness to use their own proposal system, show that the narrative in which the Ethereum Foundation followed the will of the community was clearly wrong. What the Ethereum foundation did was the opposite of decentralized decision making.
 
-# Conclusion
+## Conclusion
 
 Decentralized decision making is part of the deep security that protects the integrity of the Ethereum Classic blockchain. It is critical for keeping the promise of "applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference."
