For compatibility with ETH it is both\n+necessary and desirable.\n+\n+Short of imminent and catatrophic danger to the ETC network, making retroactive changes which break\n+backwards compatibility is counter to ETC values and philosophy.\n+\n+Gas-repricings to balance EVM gas prices with real world resource usage is entirely rational and is\n+happening on the ETC protocol too, but will be done in a backwards-compatible ways wherever possible.\n+Unconditional retroactive (\"emergency\") repricings would only happen when the network has been halted\n+or has been rendered unusable.\n+\n+An example of such a situation occurred following the Shanghai attacks on ETH and ETC networks:\n+\n+[ECIP 1015: Long-term gas cost changes for IO-heavy operations to mitigate transaction spam attacks](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1015), which has ETC's equivalent to [ETH Tangerine Whistle](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-608),\n+with both chains implementing [EIP 150: Gas cost changes for IO-heavy operations](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-150).\n+\n+\n+### Implementation\n+\n+Adoption of the content of this ECIP requires a hard fork as it introduces changes that are not backward compatible.\n+\n+The following clients with Ethereum Classic support implement the _Istanbul_ features currently:\n+\n+- Parity Ethereum\n+- Multi-Geth\n+- Hyperledger Besu\n+\n+The author is unaware if any of these clients have implemented [EIP-1706](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1706), but it is a very simple change, analogous to [EIP-2200](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2200), which all the\n+codebases have already implemented.\n+\n+Similarly [ECIP-1080](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/266) has not been implemented in any of these codebases, but is just a \"remix\" of code which they have already implemented.\n+\n+\n+## Copyright",
