    "body": "\"Odd\" referring to \"not match the original intent\", @BelfordZ?\r\n\r\nThe scope which we agreed to in the meeting was \"Istanbul - 1884\" with an implicit understanding that removing 1884 was removing the breaking gas-repricings.  When Wei came to do the implementation, he found that we had actually misspecified, because we had \"thrown the baby out with the bathwater\" in two ways - firstly with the SELFBALANCE opcode, and second in an interaction between two of the EIPs which assumed that 1884 was present.\r\n\r\nPhoenix addresses those two mis-specifications.   All this detailed by Wei on his website.",
