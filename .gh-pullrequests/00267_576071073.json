    "body": "They have explicitly requested that their pseudonyms be used.   I don't see any room for interpretation whatsoever.  Your continued refusal to acknowledge that right of theirs *is* doxing.\r\n\r\n\"If editors are all anonymous, we will have no idea of the responsibilities and it will have serious consequences of credibility for ECIP as a whole. This, of course, does not mean that anonymous figures cannot participate in ECIP process -- they can, just not as public facing ECIP editors.\"\r\n\r\nYou have made this up.  The ECIP process states no such thing.\r\n\r\n\"As a convention, ECIP-1000 should be updated by supplying amendment ECIPs. When those amendment ECIPs moved to final, the changes can be applied to ECIP-1000. This PR failed to follow the convention.\"\r\n\r\nThat is a convention which I actually suggested (and which has not been implemented).   You have not followed that convention yourself, and again you have just conjured this requirement out of thin air.\r\n",
