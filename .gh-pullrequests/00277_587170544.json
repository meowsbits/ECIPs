    "body": "> For the historical record, nobody has asked Wei to “leave”.\r\n\r\nnice try to save face but your boy donald seems to have not read the memo.\r\n\r\n> All that is being proposed is that his ECIP Editor privileges be revoked (because he has repeatedly abused them) \r\n\r\nthe only abuse here comes from team **krykoder**. this outcome was expected since you petty people started playing this Afri drama.\r\n\r\n> and that we purpose to replace ECIP-1000 with ECIP-0001 because he has abused his position as the author of that process too.\r\n\r\nCan't you honestly tell who's abusing the process right now?\r\n\r\n> He can still author ECIPs, he can still carry on with his core development work and his valuable work on corepaper, if he chooses. \r\n\r\nyeah that's the definition of volunteer. thanks *rolls eyes*\r\n\r\n> His work in those domains is highly valued and appreciated. But ECIP Editor is something different. It requires soft skills and empathy which are not his forte.\r\n\r\nThis is an admission that he is being pushed out for not having **soft skills and empathy** (_aka didn't keep his mouth shut when you started rushing code_). \r\n\r\n'Not his forte' according to your expertise and sole judgement alone or do you have some proof of this that you'd like to present?\r\n\r\n> If he leaves ETC entirely that is his own choice. Nobody is asking for or forcing that. The drama is of his own creation.\r\n\r\nyour boy donald seems to really not have read that memo. By the way, would your expertise in soft skills and empathy say that it's donald's forte? anyone else you'd like to declare socially inapt? probably 90% of your peers.\r\n\r\nanyway... good volunteer devs don't stick around forever neither the paid ones. \r\n\r\nfree tip: why not go back to the secondary plan and stick with the ECLIP repo instead? Doesn't seem anyone cares anymore and it would be a nice power move for the investors ;) \r\n\r\nI'm sure the bosses would love that idea. You're welcome :)\r\n",
