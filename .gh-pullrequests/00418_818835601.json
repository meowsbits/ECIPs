    "body": "I don't know what the security issue is that this is fixing, but I must admit that I'm not too concerned... Nokogiri is normally only used on processes on CI servers and the only content its handling is static and nonexecutable. If someone wants to get the error causing [the CI failure](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/418/checks?check_run_id=2311020786) resolved then I'd be very happy to approve; but I don't want to spend my time resolving it myself right now.",
