    "body": "@YazzyYaz the request for Last Call is to finalize the implementation spec. The only difference between Keccak-256 and SHA3 is the either 0x1 or 0x6 bit that goes into the padding. This PR finalizes it on the SHA3 variant of 0x6, we didn't know a year ago when it was proposed during the first 51% attack that this is what the community would favor. We also added in the implementation plan of 14,000,000 that is time sensitive, and based on the timings of when this was moved to Last Call. \r\n\r\nBecause both of these changes were just parameter changes, my thought was that they fall in the scope of a Last Call change.
