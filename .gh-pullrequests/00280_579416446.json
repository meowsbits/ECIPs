    "body": "Also, not to be an arsehole here, but you yourself said that we could not take an Accepted ECIP backwards.   While that is perhaps a dubious assertion on @sorpaas’s account, I think that he has poisoned the possibility of revising 1061 (intentionally) by publishing https://github.com/multi-geth/multi-geth/releases/tag/v1.9.7 and with the corresponding Parity-Ethereum support for 1061 as it was on Dec 20th.\r\n\r\nWhile we can argue whether or not “moving backwards” is acceptable I think it would be much better to work “well within the lines” of ECIP-1000 as written in this instance and so NOT to revise this ECIP.    Instead, a “HF which is 1061 with 1884 readded would be either an overlay HF (analogous to the Phoenix “fix”) or a new proposal (analogous to Phoenix “redo”).",
