From the block that this ECIP was activated, gaslimit would follow a\n+curve defined in this proposal rather than being subject to miner voting.\n+\n+## Rationale\n+\n+There is nothing more important to the ETC network than security and decentralization.\n+Both of those desired characteristics have already been heavily compromised in ETC\n+because of the malincentives which ETC inherited from ETH in the form of the miner\n+gaslimit voting mechanism.\n+\n+The gaslimit has been raised for the ETH mainnet first to 8M and then to 10M gas,",
