    "body": "I think leaving this in Draft status does not do any damage, so I will not escalate this further, but I will insist that this proposal was _rejected._ Otherwise, we will have yet another Wei Tang situation: willingly or unwillingly missing a call _(or coming 1 hour late)_ that has been announced for several weeks with a public agenda and well-defined scope _(mining algorithm & 51% attacks)_ and then questioning the outcome of a meeting with well over a couple of dozen attendees.\r\n\r\nAs I said, leaving this in Draft does not hurt anyone right now, and reiterating a _rejected_ proposal in future is will within the scope of the ECIP process.\r\n\r\nBut, @gitr0n1n, please do me a favor, we have enough issues at hand. There is no reason to freak out or escalate or ping everyone you know. First thing to do in such a situation is reading the notes, listening to the call recording, seeking out participants for their opinion. \r\n\r\n> Lastly, I later learned that other ECIP authors were contacted prior to the meeting regarding their attendance to the call, specifically @p3c-bot of ECIP-1049 by @q9f the call coordinator. I don't believe this proposal got a 'fair shake\" due to the SHA3 agenda.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if you missed both of the calls, but in the first of the two calls, there was an action item (among others, @developerkevin has a list somewhere) that was _\"reaching out to Alex\"_. That has nothing to do with favor or not, I was responsible for this one action item. Others were responsible for other action items.\r\n\r\nI was under the impression you are following the active developments here, so I failed to propose an action item _\"reach out to Ronin\"_. It was just during the 2nd call that when I asked for you, that you were _not_ around. And there is just so much I can do as organizer and moderator of a call. The announcement was on Github and the ticket was linked multiple times on Discord.\r\n\r\nWe had 85 people on the first call and slightly lower numbers on the second call. Please, don't say now you had no idea. Sorry.",
