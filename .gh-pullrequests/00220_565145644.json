    "body": "This ECIP is really not at all helpful.\r\n\r\nThere were misunderstandings.  We are all fallible humans.  We worked them out and we have moved on.   There are other ECIPs now being written with suggestions on how we can tighten things up to minimize the risk of such misunderstandings again.\r\n\r\nThere was no \"maliciousness\" from the participants.  We are all on the same side.  We all wanted (and still want) exactly the same scope for Aztlan.\r\n\r\nDo you really feel it is worthwhile for all to be spending such vast amounts of our precious time on this?\r\n\r\nEven if there WAS a \"breach of process\" (and that is subjective) then we held a Core Developers call to AFFIRM that we had did have consensus around 1061 as written.\r\n",
