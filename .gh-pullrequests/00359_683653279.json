I am sorry if you could not make the scheduled call.\r\n\r\nHere is a brief recap of the ECIP-1093 call just held in the Discussion Calls channel for anyone that missed it:\r\n- I read this comment out loud: https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/352#issuecomment-683462765\r\n- I asked the room if anyone objected to restoring ECIP-1093 back to Draft status.\r\n- No one objected to this action.\r\n- I concluded that the call reached rough consensus on the topic with everyone present for the scheduled call.\r\n\r\nThank you to all those who attended.",
