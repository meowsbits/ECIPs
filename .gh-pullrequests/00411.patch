+### Simple Summary
+
+Enable the outstanding Ethereum Foundation _Berlin_ network protocol upgrades on
+the Ethereum Classic network in a hard-fork code-named _Magneto_ to enable
+maximum compatibility across these networks.
+
+### Abstract
+
+Add support for a subset of protocol-impacting changes introduced in the
+Ethereum Foundation (ETH) network via the _Berlin_ hardforks. The proposed
+changes for Ethereum Classic's _Berlin_ upgrade include:
+
+- Reprices the gas cost of the `ModExp` (`0x00..05`) precompile.
+- Introduces three opcodes to support subroutines: `BEGINSUB`, `JUMPSUB`, and
+  `RETURNSUB`.
+- Increases gas cost for `SLOAD`, `*CALL`, `BALANCE`, `EXT*`, and
+  `SELFEDESTRUCT` when used for the first time in a transaction.
+- Defines a new transaction type that is an envelope for future transaction
+  types.
+- Adds a transaction type which contains an access list, a list of addresses
+  and storage keys that the transaction plans to access.
+
+This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes
+in the Classic networks:
+
+- `3_585_073` on Mordor Classic PoW-testnet (April, 2021)
+- `4_110_482` on Kotti Classic PoA-testnet (April, 2021)
+- `12_759_699` on Ethereum Classic PoW-mainnet (May, 2021)
+
+For more information on the opcodes and their respective EIPs and
+implementations, please see the _Specification_ section of this document.
+
+### Motivation
+
+To enhance the Ethereum Virtual Machine's (EVM) capabilities, various opcodes
+shall be added to the Ethereum Classic networks, all of which have been in use
+on the Ethereum Foundation networks since early 2021.
+
+### Specification
+
+Technical specifications for each EIP can be found at those documents
+respectively:
+
+- [EIP-2565](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2565): ModExp Gas Cost
+- [EIP-2315](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2315): Simple Subroutines for
+  the EVM
+- [EIP-2929](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929): Gas cost increases for
+  state access opcodes
+- [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718): Typed Transaction
+  Envelope
+- [EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930): Optional access lists
+
+### Rationale
+
+__Interoperability__: Establishing and maintaining interoperable behavior
+between Ethereum clients is essential for developers and end-user adoption,
+yielding benefits for all participating chains (e.g., ETH and ETC, Ropsten and
+Mordor, GÃ¶rli and Kotti).
+
+__Immutability__: None of the introduced new opcodes in the EVM has the
+potential to change the behavior of existing contracts; in the case where
+previously an arbitrary invalid bytecode would have been deployed to the
+network, none of them would be able to modify the state of the Ethereum Classic
+networks retrospectively. Adding opcodes to the EVM increases its functionality
+and should be considered a feature upgrade rather than a modification.
+
+### Implementation
+
+Adoption of the content of this ECIP requires a hard fork as it introduces
+changes that are not backward compatible.
+
+The following clients with Ethereum Classic support implement the _Berlin_
+features currently and will be able to support the _Magneto_ upgrade:
+
+- Core-Geth (maintained by ETC Core)
+- Hyperledger Besu (maintained by ConsenSys)
